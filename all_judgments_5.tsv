JUDGMENT

HARMS JA/

HARMS JA:
[1] 
The plaintiff (the present respondent) was employed during
1989 by Purity Ferrochrome (Pty) Ltd (hereinafter referred to as
""Purity"") to design, supply, erect and commission a smelter for smelting
chromate ore at Purity's ferrochrome  plant in Rustenburg.  This included
the provision of two furnaces.  A Japanese concern, Tanabe, as
subcontractor,  supplied the necessary technology and commissioning
and engineering services.  Each furnace has three electrode columns, the
extremities of which penetrate the ore mix and generate the heat
necessary for smelting.  Electric current is transferred through contact
shoes to the upper part of the electrodes, each being serviced by eight
shoes in such a way that the shoes are not directly in contact with the ore
mix.  Contact shoes have more the appearance of shoe soles than of
shoes, are concave on the inner surface in order to fit snugly around the

electrodes and have cavities for circulating cooling water.
[2] 
They are conventionally made of either brass or copper,
each shoe weighs several hundred kilograms and is about 1,25m in
length and 0,5m wide.  A casting process is used to manufacture them
and the defendant (the appellant), who operates a foundry, was
subcontracted by the plaintiff to produce 48 shoes made of brass.  In due
course the defendant provided the shoes ordered;  they were installed and
soon gave problems.  The plaintiff, Purity and the project manager had
great difficulty in establishing the cause of the problems and eventually
came to the conclusion that it was because the defendant had used a brass
alloy which did not conform to the British Standards Specification (BS
2870/1980 CZ103).  In the event, the plaintiff rejected the shoes,
tendered  redelivery and claimed damages.  An alternative claim based
upon an alleged repudiated settlement and which was the subject of

separate adjudication was dismissed.1   The damages claim succeeded
before Heher J and this appeal is with his leave.

1.
Its final outcome is reported: Titaco Projects (Pty) Ltd v A A Alloy Foundry (Pty) Ltd
1996 (3) SA 320 (W).
[3] 
Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc and, depending on its
intended application, the ratio between them may vary.  Impurities are
always present and the nature and quality of the brass depend upon the
identity of any particular impurity and the amount present.  The said
specification prescribes an 80:20 copper-zinc alloy with a maximum lead
content of 0,05% by mass.  It became common cause that the brass used
by the defendant contained lead far in excess of the prescribed maximum.
Generally speaking, lead deleteriously affects the quality of brass and
the higher the lead content the greater the loss of ductility and this,

depending upon the operating conditions, may manifest itself in
cracking.  The scientific explanation is fairly simple.  Lead does not
dissolve in brass like sugar does in water but remains undissolved, much
like sand.  Due to its low melting point of 327° C, it will start melting
long before the alloy which melts at about 1000° C.  Once the lead melts
it weakens the brass.
[4] 
The first issue to decide is whether the defendant was
contractually obliged to supply brass shoes with less than 0,05% of lead
by weight in accordance with the said British Standard.  The answer to
the question depends upon the interpretation of clause 1 of the written
contract (the ""purchase order"") between the parties.  Clause 1 provides
that:
""This purchase order ... constitutes the sole and entire agreement
between the parties hereto.  The Contractor's quotation is
incorporated in and made a part of this purchase order only to the

extent of specifying the nature and description of the goods
ordered. ... No other terms or conditions shall be binding upon
Purchaser unless accepted in writing.""

The focus is on the identification of the defendant's ""quotation"": the
plaintiff's case is that the quality control plan prepared by the defendant
which specified that the material to be used for the contact shoes would
conform to the British Standard was part of the quotation and was
incorporated into the purchase order because it specified the nature and
description of the goods ordered.  Although admitting the existence of
the plan the defendant denies that it formed part of its ""quotation"".
[5] 
Heher J held that if it were established that the defendant
had submitted the plan as part of its quotation, compliance with the plan
would have been a contractual obligation.  He found that a document
entitled ""Quotation"",  together with the plan, was submitted to the

plaintiff by the defendant in one envelope, and that before the conclusion
of the contract these two documents were discussed and considered
together by both parties.  These findings, which are relevant in
identifying the ""Contractor's quotation"" referred to in clause 1 of the
purchase order, were rightly not attacked on appeal.  Corroboration for
this finding is to be found in the fact that there was a reason why the
defendant would have provided a quality plan as  part and parcel of its
quotation.  According to the tender documents provided to the defendant
and on which the tender had to be based, the defendant was obliged to
""submit with his tender details of his quality plans"".  In particular, the
defendant was called upon to submit ""full details of the brass selected""
for the contact shoes and the said British Standard was suggested.  The
document headed ""Quotation"" itself did make reference to the nature of
the brass by stating that the copper-zinc ratio would be 80:20 - which

was in any event the prescribed according to the drawings prepared by
Tanabe and provided to the defendant - but it did not provide the
required full details of the brass selected.  That was set out in the
accompanying plan.  These facts satisfy me that Heher J was correct in
concluding that the quotation referred to in the purchase order was
intended by the parties to include the quality plan.  Evidence of such an
identifying nature is permissible and does not infringe the parol evidence
rule (Van Wyk v Rottcher's Saw Mills (Pty) Ltd 1948 (1) SA 983 (A) esp
at 990-992).
[6] 
Having used brass which does not conform to the prescribed
specification, the question that arises is whether the defendant was in
breach of clause 12 of the purchase order which reads:
""Contractor warrants that the goods shall be free from defects in ...
material ... and shall conform in all respects to the terms of the
purchase order. ...  If it appears within one year from the date of

placing the equipment into service for the purpose for which it
was purchased, that the equipment or any part thereof, does not
conform to these warranties, and Purchaser so notifies Contractor
within a reasonable time after its discovery, Contractor shall
thereupon promptly correct such nonconformity at its own
expense. ... Except as otherwise provided in this purchase order,
Contractor's liability shall extend to all damages proximately
caused by breach of any of the aforegoing warranties or
guarantees,  but liability shall in no event include loss of profit or
loss of use ...""

To the extent relevant to this case, the clause contains two separate and
distinct  warranties: the goods were to be free from defects and, second,
the goods had to conform in all respects to the terms of the purchase
order.  In the light of the foregoing, it follows that the brass supplied was
not in conformity with the terms of the order.  Because the general
principle is that contracts must be in forma specifica rather than by way
of equivalents (cf Maennel v Garage Continental Ltd 1910 AD 137 at
148;  Algoa Milling Co Ltd v Arkell and Douglas 1918 AD 145 at 158;

Tulbagh Municipality v Waveren Building Contractors (Pty) Ltd and
Others 1966 (4) SA 618 (A)), the defendant's failure amounted to a
breach of contract.
[7] 
Since the defendant refused to rectify the breach in terms of
the quoted clause, the extent of its liability has to be determined. The
plaintiff rejected the shoes and offered to return them to the defendant.
As a result, the plaintiff had to replace them and supply Purity with
another set in terms of its main obligation under the construction contract
which was to supply contact shoes for the smelter in accordance with its
design.  It then again matters not whether the shoes failed because of
excessive quantities of lead.
[8] 
Purity, in the meantime, had sold its smelting business,
comprising all its assets as a going concern to Consolidated Metallurgical
Industries Ltd (""CMI"") and at the time when the shoes were rejected,

Purity had no further interest in their replacement.  The plaintiff
negotiated the replacement of the 48 shoes with the new owner of the
smelter.  It settled by undertaking to provide CMI with 16 copper shoes
which costs R183 325 together with a payment of R200 634, an
alternative which was much cheaper than supplying CMI with 48 new
brass shoes of acceptable quality.  The case was argued on the
assumption that liability of the defendant for the payment of these sums
depended on whether Purity's rights to performance in terms of the
construction contract had devolved upon CMI, the supposition being that
in the absence of a contractual obligation towards CMI, the plaintiff
could not have suffered any damages.  I shall assume that this approach
is correct.  Although CMI purchased all Purity's assets - and its rights
against the plaintiff would obviously fall within that category - the fact of
the matter is that the sale agreement, whilst providing a list of ceded

contracts, omitted a reference to the construction contract.  Nevertheless
it did provide for a cession of the plaintiff's performance guarantees.  At
the time it was not suspected that the defendant had failed to supply
shoes conforming to the British Standard; to the contrary, the defendant,
innocently it seems, had transmitted to the plaintiff analysis certificates
which certified due compliance.
[9] 
Finding in favour of the plaintiff, Heher J relied heavily
upon a warranty clause in the CMI contract.  I have some hesitation in
accepting the correctness of his interpretation and prefer to base my
judgment on another ground.  Since Purity had sold all the assets of the
going concern to CMI, any contingent rights against the plaintiff - in this
case a claim for the supply or resupply of the shoes - were part of the
object sold.  As a witness attempted to point out, it hardly made sense for

CMI to have taken cession of the performance guarantees if the right to
enforce the primary performance did not also vest in CMI.  The same
witness, Smidt, who was recalled after the point had arisen for the first
time during argument, testified that as far as he could recollect, the
plaintiff had signed a cession (he probably meant a consent to a cession)
to CMI with respect to discharging all of its obligations in terms of its
relationship with Purity. Although he did not produce the document, his
evidence was not challenged and accords with the probabilities having
regard to the conduct of the parties involved after the sale.  Even the
defendant took part in the negotiations with CMI on the replacement of
the contact shoes.
[10] Two heads of damages were debated before us.  The first
concerns the damages suffered as a result of the plaintiff having settled
with CMI, a matter alluded to in par [8] above. In summary, the plaintiff

settled with CMI, undertaking to provide 16 copper shoes, making a cash
payment and providing a performance guarantee in respect of the new
shoes.  Complying with its obligations, the plaintiff applied for a
guarantee and contracted with another foundry to cast the copper shoes.
Since it had some financial and cash flow problems, the plaintiff's
holding company (""TCI"" for short) made all these payments before
summons was issued.  In the absence of a ""formal"" agreement and book
entries to reflect a debt between the plaintiff and TCI and since TCI had
written off the debt for tax purposes, the defendant argued that the
plaintiff had failed to prove that it had a legal obligation to repay TCI
and that without such an obligation the plaintiff cannot be said to have
suffered damages.  The trial judge accepted the notion that a legal
obligation to repay TCI had to be shown but concluded that there was a
tacit agreement to repay TCI whenever the plaintiff was able to do so.

[11] The plaintiff and TCI, the evidence disclosed, in conducting
their business, tended to disregard their respective corporate identities.
Employees of the one worked for and acted on the behalf of the other
whenever it suited their business.  It was not even always clear in whose
employ a particular individual was.  In negotiating with CMI, the
legendary corporate veil was discarded.  Whether TCI paid as agent,
negotiorum gestor or as donor, it paid the plaintiff's debt.  The plaintiff
suffered its loss when the breach occurred and was entitled to be
recompensed by the defendant, and the fact that TCI had paid is at best a
collateral benefit.  (Hunter v Shapiro 1955 (3) SA 28 (D); Sandown Park
(Pty) Ltd v Hunter Your Wine & Spirit Merchant (Pty) Ltd and  another
1985 (1) SA 248 (W)).  The defendant's counsel, correctly in my view,
did not attempt to support the trial court's reasoning to the contrary.
[12] Loss of management time in the other head of damages in

contention.  Forbes J in  Tate & Lyle Food and Distribution Ltd v
Greater London Council and another [1981] 3 All ER 716 (QBD)
accepted the proposition that the loss of managerial time which otherwise
might have been engaged in the trading activities of a concern and which
had to be deployed in managing the consequences of a wrongful act (in
that case a tort) can be claimed as a head of damages, provided the loss
can be quantified.  As a general proposition this must be correct.  But
there must be at least some evidence that the managers would have
expended their time on one or other income generating venture, and that
managing the consequences of the wrong was not simply dealt within the
ordinary course of their duties.
[13] Witnesses for the plaintiff analysed the time spent in
investigating the reasons for the failure of the shoes, the best means of
correcting the problem and in making good the defendant's default.

Because the plaintiff is in the business of selling the time and services of
its employees, it was able to prove the cost to it for every hour spent by
each individual employee.  The trial court, in its calculation, deducted the
profit element because the warranty clause quoted in par [6] above,
excluded claims for loss of profit.
[14] Due recognition must be given to the fact that it is extremely
difficult to prove damages such as these and that in assessing the
sufficiency of the evidence ""a fairly robust approach"" may be adopted
(Thompson v Scholtz 1999 (1) SA 232 (SCA) 249B).
[15] During his evidence in chief, the plaintiff's witness, Wilson,
testified that there was a loss for the plaintiff because ""if there was no
problem with the contact shoes we would not have to do that and that is
time lost to us.""  He conceded during cross-examination that the cost to
the company of, say, his salary did not change because that cost was a

constant.  This evidence did not address the issue.  However, Smidt, the
chief executive officer of the plaintiff gave the following evidence:
""There is one suggestion which was made, and I would like you to
deal with it, to Mr Wilson, namely that if one has regard to
EXHIBIT M it was suggested that these employees of the plaintiff,
including yourself and Mr Wilson, were paid their salaries by the
plaintiff in any event, whether they were busy dealing with contact
shoes problems or any other problems and therefore plaintiff
cannot suggest that time spent on the contact shoe problem
constitutes a loss to the plaintiff. C I think that presupposes that
our people would otherwise have stood doing nothing and would
not be recovered in other areas.  I think if you accept that,
generally speaking, a large proportion of our income is derived
from recovery and sale of man hours it does not really hold true.  I
think had they not been working in this area they would have been
working elsewhere in a recoverable manner.""

Smidt was not cross-examined on the issue and the matter was left
somewhat in the air. Since there is nothing to gainsay the slightly
tentative evidence and taking less than a robust view of the matter, I
believe that the evidence suffices to establish as a probability that the

time spent would otherwise have been utilized gainfully, especially in
view of  the nature of the plaintiff's business.
[16] Turning ultimately to the question of costs, Heher J ordered
the defendant to pay costs on the scale as between attorney and own
client.   Because I am of the view that the judge misdirected himself on a
number of aspects relating to costs, it becomes necessary to deal in some
detail with his findings relative to the issue.
[17] The defendant's witness, Smith, gave false evidence relating
to the question whether the quality control plan accompanied the
quotation.  However, to hold that this issue was the ""real dispute"" in the
case and that but for it  the case would have been substantially shortened
in my view overstates the position.  Counsel's submission that the dispute
did not contribute more than 10% to the case is closer to the mark.
Dishonesty on one of a large number of issues does not usually justify  a

special order as to costs in relation to the whole of the case, including the
expensive technical evidence which was triggered by the allegations
made by the plaintiff in its particulars of claim, superfluously as it
transpired in the end.  For example, of the six warranties relied upon, the
plaintiff eventually abandoned five, and of the eight breaches it
succeeded on one.
[18] Another pebble in the judicial shoe was the defendant's ""ill-
judged attempt to obstruct the course of justice.""  Seven instances were
enumerated where the defendant had refused to make requested
admissions; some of the refusals were found to have been without a bona
fide basis, unnecessary, without substance, vexatious or opportunistic.
Except in one instance, the disputed items became common cause or did
not take up more than a page or two of evidence.  The exception relates

to an admission on quantum or aspects of quantum. Although the
behaviour of the defendant was irritating and somewhat obstructive, it
succeeded to reduce the quantum from about R480 000 to R400 000.
The fact is, the plaintiff would probably have been absolved from the
instance if it was not permitted to reopen its case to present evidence on
damages during argument.  Once again, in the context of the case as a
whole, the defendant's recalcitrant behaviour on this aspect did not
substantially increase the costs.  It is noteworthy that the trial judge, in
dealing with the refusal to admit quantum did not brand the defendant's
behaviour with any deprecatory epithet or adjective.
[19] The final complaint about the defendant's conduct relates to
the fact that despite requests from the plaintiff, the defendant's expert
failed to attend a pre-trial conference with the plaintiff's new expert.  A
meeting had been held with the plaintiff's former expert, but it produced

nothing of consequence.  Having read and reread the expert evidence, I
am unable to envisage how the litigation would have been curtailed by a
meeting.  The scientific battle lines were clearly drawn and each stuck to
his own gun.  In any event, it was within the province of the trial judge to
have ordered a conference during the trial, something that was not done.
[20] To sum up, in considering a punitive costs order a court
should warn itself against using hindsight in assessing the conduct of a
party.  The defendant had an eminent expert who gave an opinion based
upon experimental data which was not controverted and was entitled to
rely thereon.  Its defences were substantial although in retrospect
misconceived.  Even the trial judge by granting leave to appeal thought
that there was a reasonable prospect of success on appeal.  The learned
judge did refer to authorities that hold that dishonesty in the proceedings

and presenting false evidence are grounds for awarding costs on the
attorney and client scale but the quantum leap to the ""own"" portion was
not explained.  Although invited to deal with the difference between the
two types of attorney and client costs, but not having had the advantage
of full argument, I wish to say as little as possible.  It has become notable
that a practice has taken roots in some jurisdictions of making awards of
costs on an attorney and own client scale where someone other than the
own client or his privy is involved.  Whether such orders are justified or
justifiable in the light of decisions of this Court (such as Nel v Waterberg
Landbouwers Ko-operatiewe Vereeniging 1946 AD 597) may to be
questioned.  Further, sight appears to be lost of the fact that they may
have unexpected or unforeseeable consequences (Cambridge Plan AG v
Cambridge Diet (Pty) Ltd and Others 1990 (2) SA 574 (T)).
[21] Having identified a number of material misdirections, this

Court is entitled to exercise its own discretion.  Because there is nothing
special about the defendant's conduct, excepting Smith's dishonesty,
which deserves the severe opprobrium of a special costs order in this
case, costs ought to be on a party and party scale. It is not feasible to
isolate the costs caused by the dishonesty in order to make a special
award in that regard.  The defendant's limited success on appeal cannot
carry the costs of appeal. The employment of two counsel by the plaintiff
for purpose of the appeal, on the other hand, was fully justified having
regard to the nature and scope of the appeal.
The following order is made:
(a)
The appeal is upheld to the extent only that par 4 of the order of
the court a quo is amended to read: ""Costs of suit as between party
and party.""
(b)
The appeal is otherwise dismissed with costs, including the costs

of two counsel.

UITSPRAAK

VAN HEERDEN AHR:
Afgesien van ander oorwegings kan die appèl nie slaag nie tensy bewys is dat
Volkskas teenoor die appellant die voorstelling gemaak het dat ‘n nuwe
huurkontrak ten opsigte van die voorhaker tussen McGregor en Volkskas
aangegaan was.

Ek bespeur nie in die appellant se eie getuienis ‘n ondubbelsinnige aanduiding
dat Jacobs so ‘n voorstelling gemaak het nie. Die appellant het bont gepraat,
maar by ontleding van sy getuienis het Jacobs volgens hom slegs gesê dat
indien ‘n nuwe kontrak gesluit sou word (d.w.s. in die toekoms) die appellant van
sy borgstelling bevry sou wees.
Hoe dit ook al sy, Jacobs ontken dat hy te kenne gegee het dat ‘n nuwe kontrak
reeds gesluit was, en aangesien hy geweet het dat dit nog nie gebeur het nie is
dit heel onwaarskynlik dat hy so iets sou gesê het.
Die appellant se advokaat het ook gesteun op ‘n voorstelling wat Volkskas deur
gedrag sou gemaak het. Die betrokke betoog stuit egter teen die nadere
besonderhede wat tot die verweerskrif verstrek is. In antwoord op ‘n vraag hoe
Volkskas die skyn, waarop die appellant gesteun het, verwek het, is naamlik
gesê dat die appellant aldus meegedeel was. Daar was gevolglik geen sprake
van gedrag — in teenstelling tot ‘n mededeling — waarop die appellant hom
beroep het nie.
Die betoog het in elk geval weinig om die lyf. Die aanvaarding deur Volkskas van
die bedrag van R5 000 wat McGregor betaal het en die lewering van die
voorhaker aan hom, was immers goed vereenselwigbaar met een of ander
tussentydse reëling wat met McGregor aangegaan was.
Ander argumente wat namens die appellant geopper is, is eweneens sonder pit
en hoef nie vermeld te word nie.
Die appèl word met koste afgewys.

Labour law - unfair dismissal - reinstatement

FARLAM AJA

J U D G M E N T

FARLAM AJA:
[1] The appellant is a company involved in the mining industry, the civil engineering
industry and in leasing out civil engineering and mining equipment.
[2] On 10 August 1992 the appellant dismissed those of its workers who had participated
in a nationwide stay-away which took place on Monday 3 and 4 August 1992 and which was
called by the ANC - COSATU - SA Communist Party Alliance to protest against the collapse

of the CODESA constitutional negotiations.
[3] The dismissed workers, together with their union, the National Union of
Metalworkers of SA, sought reinstatement in unfair labour practice proceedings in the
Industrial Court before Labuschagne AM.
All the workers who were dismissed, with the exception of those who worked at a site
at Syferfontein, had participated in an earlier stay-away on 23 July 1992.  The Industrial
Court ordered the reinstatement of the workers who were employed at the Syferfontein site
but the application failed in so far as it related to the other employees.
[4] The unsuccessful applicants appealed to the Labour Appeal Court (LAC) where the
matter was heard by Cameron J and two assessors.  The appeal was allowed and the
determination of the Industrial Court (insofar as it related to the unsuccessful individual
applicants) was set aside and in its place was substituted a determination to the effect that the
dismissal of the individual applicants was an unfair labour practice and that they were to be
reinstated in their employ on terms and conditions no less favourable than those which were
operative at the date of their dismissal.  It was further ordered that the reinstatement was to be
effected from 20 February 1996, being the date of the Industrial Court determination but not
from any preceding date.  There was no order as to the costs of the appeal.
[5] The judgment of the Industrial Court has been reported: see  [1996] 3 BLLR  330
(IC).  The judgment of the LAC  has also been reported: see (1997) 18 ILJ 123 (LAC).
[6] Counsel for the appellant attacked some of the findings made by the LAC
and submitted that this court is not bound thereby.  On the other hand counsel who appeared
for the respondents, relying on National Union of Mineworkers v East Rand Gold and
Uranium Co Ltd 1992 (1) SA 700 (A) at 723 B - G,  Performing Arts Council of the
Transvaal v Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers= Union and Others 1994 (2) SA 204
(A) at 214 E - F, National Union of Metalworkers of SA v Vetsak Co-operative Ltd and
Others 1996 (4) SA 577 (A) at 593 H - I and 583 I - 584 C and the judgments of Smalberger
JA and Scott JA in Betha and Others v BTR Sarmcol,  a Division of  BTR Dunlop Ltd 1998
(3) SA 349 (SCA)  at 387 C - F and 405 C - 406 E, contended that this court is bound by such
findings inasmuch as they related to the facts.

The main findings which counsel for the appellant attacked related to the question as
to whether the workers in the appellant=s employ could have been
confused about the appellant=s policy regarding stay-aways immediately before they
participated in the stay-away which took place on 3 and 4 August.  The findings of the LAC
which appellant=s counsel attacked are contained in the LAC=s reported judgment at 145 E - I.
For the purposes of this judgment I am prepared to assume, without deciding the point, that
this Court is entitled to overturn the findings in question.  On the view I take of the matter
these findings are not decisive on the question as to whether the appellant=s action in
dismissing the individual respondents was an unfair labour practice.
[7] This court=s task is to pass what by its nature is a moral or value judgment on the
question as to whether the appellant=s action in dismissing the individual respondents
amounted to an unfair labour practice.  The ultimate determinant in such an enquiry is
fairness, by which is meant fairness to both the employer and the employee.
[8] Obviously the inquiry whether the dismissals in this case were fair or unfair involves
a consideration of all the relevant facts.  As the judgments of both the Industrial Court and
the LAC have been reported it will be sufficient to give a summary of the more significant
facts.
[9] The first stay-away experienced by the appellant was on Soweto Day, 16 June 1992.
On 15 June 1992 the appellant had a meeting with representatives of the union, viz
the union organizer from Witbank and the elected shop stewards.  It was agreed at the
meeting that the 16 June stay-away would be dealt with by the application of the principle
Ano work/no pay/no penalty@.
[10] After the 16 June 1992 stay-away a meeting took place between the management of
the appellant and the union organiser and three of the shop stewards.  After this meeting
management issued a memorandum to all staff members in which it was stated that in future
disciplinary action would be taken against any person taking part in an illegal strike/stay-
away action.
[11] On 21 July a further meeting took place between management and the union organiser
and certain shop stewards.  At this meeting the union organiser mentioned that the union

planned certain actions beginning on 22 July but  not that a stay-away was anticipated for 23
July.
[12] On 22 July, after 4 pm, one of the shop stewards told the appellant=s managing
director and its plant director that a stay-away was planned for the next day.
On 23 July
the planned stay-away, which took the form of a march to the office of the local receiver of
revenue, took place.
[13] On 24 July the workers returned to work and each was served with a notice to attend a
disciplinary hearing on 25 July.  The charges were:
failing to report for duty on 23 July 1992;
absence without permission from work; and
disobeying company rules and regulations.
[14] On 25 July disciplinary hearings were held.  Those who had stayed away on 23 July
were found guilty and dismissed.    The dismissals were not implemented but instead, at the
end of the proceedings on 25 July it was agreed that a meeting would be held on Tuesday 28
July.   On 27 July the workers were given the day off to prepare themselves for the meeting
the following day.
[15] On 28 July  the meeting to which I have referred was held at the appellant=s head
office between the whole workforce and representatives of management.  The shop stewards
were present but no union officials.  The meeting was held in a large marquee tent which was
hired for the occasion.  In evidence and argument this meeting was called the Atentberaad@.
Although there was a dispute in the evidence between Van Rooyen, the appellant=s
plant director, who was the only witness called on its behalf, and Maduna, one of the shop
stewards,  who testified on behalf of the respondents, as to the purpose of the Atentberaad@ the
LAC found that the determination of stay-away policy was pivotal to the meeting.  A
workers= committee, or liaison committee, was elected in the presence of management.  The
LAC found that the liaison committee idea originated with management and that its purpose
was to liaise with management on future stay-aways.  The LAC also found that the liaison
committee  replaced the shop stewards committee but that management in initiating the

liaison committee had not deliberately attempted to sideline the union.  Nevertheless, so it
was held, management had  acted imprudently (albeit in good faith) in procuring the
replacement of the union and elected union representatives by the workers themselves.  The
LAC in fact described  management=s action in initiating the liaison committee as a Agaffe@.
[16] There was a dispute on the evidence as to whether those present at the Atentberaad@
decided in principle, as management alleged,  that the entire workforce would in future report
for duty in the event of a stay-away but, if not, the hours to be lost would be worked in, in
advance, so as to stockpile coal.  In addition it was agreed, so the appellant averred, that a
core of workers would in any event report for duty during stay-aways.
[17] The Industrial Court found that the workers did agree at the Atentberaad@ as the
appellant alleged: see its judgment at 337 E - F.  This finding was overturned by the LAC
which found that no final or binding agreement was reached at the Atentberaad@: see the LAC
judgment at 134 F.  In my opinion there is no basis for not accepting this finding by the LAC,
whichever of the approaches to factual findings of the LAC set out in the various judgments
in Betha and Others v BTR Sarmcol, a Division of BTR Dunlop Ltd, supra is adopted.
[18] At the Atentberaad@ the dismissals of the workers for participating in the 23 July stay-
away were withdrawn.  There was a dispute between the parties as to whether after the
dismissals were withdrawn the workers were given an oral final warning.  Although the LAC
said that it was open to question whether or not a warning was given it held (at 136 F) that
Athe presence or absence of such a warning and its status as final or otherwise is . . . not
decisive for the justice of the case@.
[19] On Wednesday 29 July, after the union=s  Witbank organizer had warned one of the
shop stewards that the election of the liaison committee meant Ataking the union out@, the
workers had a meeting at which it was decided that those elected to the liaison committee
would withdraw therefrom.
[20] During the morning of Thursday 30 July the two headquarters representatives on the
committee met with management.  After lunch the headquarters representatives did not return
to the meeting: instead they sent a letter saying that they had decided to withdraw because Ato
be in the committee is too demanding@. The LAC found that this reason was absurd and
evasive and that the reason given later,  that they perceived the liaison committee to be a

strategy of the appellant designed to bypass proper consultation with the duly elected shop
stewards= committee and/or officials of the union, was Aboth more candid and more accurate@
(at 135 G).
[21] Following on the collapse of the liaison committee neither the representatives of
management nor the workers appear to have made any effort to re-establish lines of
communication so that hours could be worked in, in  advance, so as to stockpile coal before
the impending two day stay-away planned for 3 and 4 August (for which a general nation-
wide  call had gone out some three weeks before) and arrangements could be made for a core
of workers to work on 3 and 4 August.
Instead management caused a memorandum to
be put in each worker=s pay packet on Friday, 31 August.  This memorandum, which each
worker received just before leaving on the Apay weekend@ immediately before the stay-away
planned for Monday 3 and Tuesday 4 August, read as follows:
AVERY IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!
The following steps will be taken against persons not at work on the 3rd of August
1992.
NO WORK NO PAY
NORMAL BONUS PENALIZATION PROCEDURE
Persons not at work on 4 August 1992 or any other day in future on which a
stay-away or mass action takes place, will run the risk of being
DISCHARGED IMMEDIATELY !!!
By order
BENICON MANAGEMENT@

[22] On 3 and 4 August only 63 of the appellant=s workforce reported for duty.
[23] On Wednesday 5 August the workers returned to work.  Each received an  AAdvice to
Attend disciplinary Hearing@, which read in part as follows:

AAlleged misconduct: not at work on 3rd and 4th of August 1992.  The charges against
you are: Absent from work without permission.@

[24] On Thursday 6 August, after a mass hearing, conducted at the insistence of the
workers, they were found guilty of misconduct.
[25] Further discussions then took place on Friday 7 and Monday 10 August.  The subject
of the discussions was further stay-aways.   Van Rooyen testified  that these discussions were
designed to ascertain whether satisfactory arrangements could be made with regard to future
stay-away actions, which could then serve as mitigation in the determination of an
appropriate sanction.
[26] No agreement on this topic was arrived at.  The workers insisted that the principle Ano
work/no pay/no penalty@ should apply in respect of future stay-aways and that if some
personnel was to be provided during future stay-aways management had to furnish full
security for it.
[27] Appellant was not prepared to agree thereto.  Its response was to propose to the union
that the workers who had been found guilty of misconduct for participating in the stay-away
should not be dismissed provided every employee signed an agreement in the following
terms:
A1
Hundred per cent attendance of all employees during any further stay-away,
mass action, illegal strike and/or any planned or unplanned work boycotts or
go-slow actions.
With reference to the actions mentioned in para 1 Benicon would not only
expect employees to be present at their normal place of work, but also to
perform their normal duties at the required production tempo.
Normal working hours must be adhered to during action referred to in para 1.
Should the employees not attend work and perform as stipulated in 1, 2 and 3,
the employees= action will be viewed as breach of this agreement and will be
dismissed immediately.

Benicon undertakes not to lock out any employee who wishes to attend work
at such times referred to as in para 1.
All other Benicon rules and regulations must be adhered to.@

This proposal having been rejected, the workers were dismissed, retrospectively from
4 August.
[28] Management was however, despite the dismissals, prepared to take the workers back,
provided they accepted its terms.  The re-employment terms included an absolute prohibition
on future participation in stay-aways.  A Memorandum of Agreement dated 12 August
between the appellant and certain newly re-employed workers read:
A1
The employee undertakes not to take part in any future illegal industrial
action, mass actions, or stay-aways, and to be present at his workplace and to
perform his duties faithfully.
The employee undertakes to abide by all the rules and regulations of the
company at all times.
The company undertakes not to lock out the employee during any action
referred to in para 1, if he turns up to work.
The company undertakes to sanction [rescind?] the decision to dismiss the
employee as a result of the disciplinary hearing held on 6 August 1992.
Instead a final written warning will be placed on his file.@

[39] The Industrial Court, as has been said, refused the application for re-instatement save
in so far as it related to the workers at the Syferfontein site.  A substantial part of its judgment
is devoted to comparing the facts of this case with those in National Union of Mineworkers &
Others v Free State Consolidated Gold Mines (Operations) Ltd;  President Steyn Mine;
President Brand Mine; Freddies Mine, 1996 (1) SA 422 (A) (the AFreegold case@): see the
reported judgment of the Industrial Court at 349 F - 353 C.

[30] One of the factors strongly relied on by the Industrial Court in support of its finding
that the dismissals were not an unfair labour practice was the fact that the workers had, as the
Industrial Court put it, Areneged  on their undertaking@ given at the Atentberaad@ to minimise
the disruption of the appellant=s operations: see the judgment at 351 E - F.  As has previously
been pointed out, the Industrial Court=s finding that such an undertaking was given by
workers at the Atentberaad@ was overturned by the LAC.
[31] The Industrial Court also found that contracts the appellant had with its customers had
been cancelled because of the August production standstill.  The LAC found that the
evidence did not warrant this finding and that it was never established that causally the
cancellations which did take place thereafter were attributable to the standstill.
[32] The LAC held that the factual premises and reasoning on which the Industrial Court
concluded that the dismissals in this case were fair could not be sustained.  It summarised its
views on the merits at 146 G - 147 C of the reported judgment.
[33] Among the points made by the LAC was that management was Ain central measure
responsible@ for the breakdown in communication between management and the workers
shortly before the pay weekend of 1 and 2 August, which preceded the stay-away.  This was
because A[i]ts liaison committee initiative was naive in its conception and misdirected in its
execution.  After this@, so continued the LAC, Athe formulation or finalisation of a mutually
acceptable policy in time for the 3 - 4 August stay-away became impossible.  To hold the
workers solely liable, as the Industrial Court did, is most inequitable.@  (See the judgment at
146 H - I.)
[34] Mr Rabie, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, contended that the LAC fell into
error in adopting this approach.  He submitted that even if the appellant did make a mistake
in initiating the election of the liaison committee this factor was irrelevant to a decision as to
whether the dismissals were unfair.  He said that this was so because it was clear that even if
the Atentberaad@ had not taken place the stay-away would still have occurred and the
dismissed workers would have participated therein.
[35] He submitted further that the workers= subjective perception of their entitlement to
join the stay-away was also irrelevant to the decision as to whether the dismissals were unfair
and that the LAC erred in regarding it as a mitigating factor.

[36] He also argued that an important aggravating factor to which adequate weight had not
been accorded  by the LAC was the fact that the continued existence of the appellant had
been put in danger by the workers= participation in the stay-away.
[37] In my view these contentions cannot be sustained.  It is clear from what was said in
the Freegold case (at 449 C) that even if the stay-away was not to be regarded as a legitimate
form of protest in the particular circumstances of this case (a matter on which I, like the
LAC, express no opinion), the fact that those who participated in the stay-away perceived it
to be  legitimate and regarded their absence as being for good reason constitutes a mitigating
factor to be taken into account in any equitable assessment of the fairness of the dismissals.
[38] It was also not correct to say that the management=s Atentberaad@ initiative regarding
the liaison committee was not causally related to what happened thereafter and was
accordingly irrelevant.  While it is true to say that the workers on all the probabilities would
have participated in the stay-away even if the Atentberaad@ had not taken place the matter
does not end there.  I say that because Mr Rabie contended that it was an aggravating factor,
weighing against the workers, that their participation in the stay-away had put the future
existence of the appellant at risk.  This was due, in part at least, to the fact that extra hours
had not been worked in, in advance, before the stay-away so that a stockpile of coal could be
produced to tide the appellant over the stay-away period when production would cease.  In
my view the fact that a stockpile was not produced was due, again in part at least, to the
breakdown in communication between management and the workers which followed on
management=s Agaffe@, as the LAC called it, in initiating the formation of the liaison
committee.  That being so, there was a causal connection between the putting at risk of the
continued existence of the company  and the appellant=s actions at the Atentberaad@, which
affected the weight to be given to this factor in deciding on the fairness of the dismissals.   It
follows that in assessing the fairness of the dismissals what one can call the Atentberaad@
factor was relevant. It follows further that the  factor which Mr Rabie submitted was an
important aggravating factor weighing against the workers was not accorded insufficient
weight by the LAC.
[39] When a moral judgment or value judgment has to be  passed regarding the fairness or
unfairness of the dismissals  it is important to bear in mind, in my view, on the particular

circumstances of this case, that the appellant, even after the stay-away, was willing to keep
the workers in its employ if they were prepared to agree not to participate in future illegal
stay-aways.  If they had breached such an agreement in the future it would have been difficult
to contend that their dismissal for such breach would not be fair.  But essentially the same
result could have been achieved by keeping them in their employment but giving them a final
written warning.  Such an approach would have been more in keeping with the view, to
which this court has given its approval (Freegold case at 448 H - I), that dismissal Ais the
ultimate sanction; a course of last resort@.
[40] In my opinion the dismissals in this matter were unfair and the appeal against the
LAC=s judgment should be  dismissed with costs including those of two counsel, there being
in my view no reason that costs should not follow the result.
[41] Together with the appeal  three applications for condonation were argued: two
brought by the appellant (one for the late filing of the notice of appeal and the other for the
late filing of the record) and one by the respondents (for the late filing of an affidavit
opposing the appellant=s application for condonation of the late filing of the record).
[42] In my opinion all three applications should be granted.  The respondents= application
was not opposed and nothing more need be said about it.  The appellant=s applications were
opposed but it is clear that its failure to file its notice of appeal and the appeal record
timeously was not due to any default on its part but to the negligence of its attorney.
It
cannot be said on the facts of this case that it must have been obvious to the appellant that
there was a protracted delay and it is not disputed that it had left the matter entirely to its
attorney, in whom it had full confidence, and that it had no reason to believe that the rules
had not been complied with.  As far as the costs of the appellant=s applications for
condonation are concerned Mr Rabie conceded that the respondents were entitled to the costs
of the application including the costs of opposition.

[43] Since writing paragraphs [1] to [42] above I have had the advantage of reading the
judgment prepared in this matter by my learned brother Olivier in which the view is stated
that the respondent workers were not unfairly dismissed by the appellant.  I have carefully
considered all the points made in my learned brother=s judgment and have retraced in my

mind all the steps along the path which led me to the conclusion that the appeal should be
dismissed.  Having done so, I remain of the view that the dismissals in question were unfair.
[44] As appears from paragraph [6] of my learned brother=s judgment  the major point of
disagreement between us is whether the decision of the LAC that management was Ain central
measure@ responsible for the breakdown in  communications and that Aits liaison committee
initiative was naive in its conception and misdirected in its execution@ has to be accepted as
correct and relevant.  I agree with the LAC=s finding on the point and am of the view that we
are bound by it.  Whichever of the differing approaches  to factual findings of the LAC set
out in the BTR case is adopted I am satisfied that no basis exists for overturning the LAC=s
finding on this point.  I am not aware of any misdirection by the LAC nor do I think that it
can be said that no reasonable court could have come to that finding.
Indeed the passages from Van Rooyen=s evidence quoted by my brother in my
respectful view, support the LAC=s finding.
When asked the direct question who first came up with the idea of a new committee
Van Rooyen=s answer was hardly a model of clarity but he did say that the workers agreed
that the problem at the various sites was different and he added that they, i e, management,
said that if every site chose its representative to bring the site=s problems to management then
the problem would be so much easier.  These answers go very far in my view in providing a
basis for the LAC=s finding on the point that the initiative for the setting up of the liaison
committee came from management, as Maduna testified.  Once one accepts this finding by
the LAC then the impact of the other factors listed in paragraph [14] (a) to (h) of my brother=s
judgment becomes far less important.
[45] My learned brother then poses two questions which he says are the real important
ones: (a) was the appellant=s demand that the workers undertake not to participate in future
illegal stay-aways reasonable?  And (b) was the refusal of the workers to accede to this
request reasonable?
I am not sure that these questions are the real important ones nor do I think that the
converse of a finding in favour of management on the first is a finding against the workers on
the second.  As my learned brother fairly points out (in paragraph [13] of his judgment) the
workers were in an invidious position.

[46] What may be called the bottom line of my learned brother=s judgment is to be found,
in my view, in his statement in paragraph [11] that the refusal of the employees to agree to a
regime of non-participation  in illegal stay-aways inexorably implies an intention to take part
in illegal action against the employer and Athe law cannot countenance such an attitude@.
I agree that the law cannot countenance such an attitude  and I also agree   that the
law will not inexorably uphold a dismissal in such a situation.   I have tried to show in my
judgment that there was something the employer could have done, falling short of dismissal,
which would have been appropriate in this case.
[47] That does not mean that the workers were free from blame and not liable to
disciplinary action.  Indeed as counsel for the respondents pointed out, the order made by the
LAC, that the workers were only to be re-instated with effect from the date of the Industrial
Court=s order, does involve disciplinary steps being taken against the workers.  Though they
were not solely responsible for the fact that steps were not taken to minimise the effects of
the disruption (as the Industrial Court wrongly found) they were to a substantial degree
responsible and disciplinary steps, falling short of dismissal, were appropriate.
[48] My learned brother seeks to make something of the fact, which I accept without
hesitation, that the appellant adopted an accommodating and supportive attitude towards the
workers and says (paragraph [14] (d)) that Athis, surely is not the attitude of an employer bent
on getting rid of its employees in an unfair manner@.  I do not understand that to be the test.
The dismissals cannot only be set aside if the employer was Abent on getting rid of its
employers in an unfair manner@ (and to be fair to my learned brother I do not understand him
to say that that is the test).
[49] What has been said over and over again in these cases is that one must be fair to both
sides.  If the only test to be applied is fairness to the employer then there is much to be said
for a finding in the appellant=s favour.  But fairness to the workers, in my considered
judgment, requires a disciplinary step falling short of the course of last resort.
[50] The following order is made:
(a)
Appellant=s applications for condonation for the late filing of the notice of
appeal and the appeal record are granted.

(b)
Appellant is ordered to pay the respondents= costs of the applications including
the costs of opposition.
Respondents= application for condonation of the late filing of their affidavit opposing
appellant=s application for condonation for the late filing of the appeal record is
granted.
The appeal is dismissed with costs including the costs of two counsel.

OLIVIER JA
[1] I do not share the view that the appeal falls to be dismissed.
[2] Cameron J summarized the reasons for his finding that the dismissal was unfair as
follows:
There was confusion, both in reality and in the workers= minds,
about the consistency and rigour of management=s policy on stay-
aways.
There was a breakdown in communication between Benicon and
its employees, following on the disintegration of the liaison
committee on 30 July, shortly before the weekend preceding the

stay-away.   Management was in central measure responsible for
that breakdown.   Its liaison committee initiative was naïve in its
conception and misdirected in execution.   After this, the
formulation or finalisation of a mutually acceptable policy in time
for the 3 and 4 August stay-away became impossible.   To hold
the workers solely liable, as the industrial court did, is most
inequitable.
Unlike some strike cases, the withdrawal of labour here did not
involve a fight to the death. By admission of the perpetrators, and
by recognition of management, the stay-away was designed to be
incidental and limited.
Benicon seems to have dismissed the workers not for participation
in the stay-away on 3 and 4 August, but for refusing to agree to
work on future stay-aways.
In order to deal with these  reasons a brief discussion of the events from June to August 1992 is
required. I will refer to the appellant as Benicon.
[3] Although Benicon agreed on 15 June not to take disciplinary action against workers who
did not report for duty on Soweto day (16 June),  management issued a notice to all staff
members on 19 June in the following terms:

ARE : ILLEGAL STRIKE ACTION/STAY-AWAY ACTION

Please take note of the following :
In future disciplinary action will be taken against any person taking part
in an illegal strike/stay-away action.
By order.
BENICON MANAGEMENT@

The company=s policy could not have been expressed in clearer terms. Yet, on 23 July, another
stay-away occurred when its workers joined a march to the office of the Receiver of Revenue.
Not unexpectedly their conduct lead to disciplinary hearings and the dismissal of all the guilty
ones.  But the dismissals were not immediately implemented because the workers wanted to
discuss matters and management was prepared to listen. For this purpose the tentberaad  was
arranged and held on 28 July. The so-called workers= committee was elected and the dismissals
withdrawn. But the committee soon proved to be a failure and, because there was an imminent
threat of another stay-away on 3 and 4 August, management on 31 July  had the following notice
inserted in every worker=s pay-packet :

AVERY IMPORTANT NOTICE!!!
The following steps will be taken against persons not at work on
the 3rd of August 1992.
<
NO WORK NO PAY
<
NORMAL BONUS PENALISATION PROCEDURE
<
Persons not at work on the 4th of August 1992 or any other
day in future on which a stay-away or mass action takes
place, will run the risk of being DISCHARGED
IMMEDIATELY!!!!
By order
BENICON MANAGEMENT@

With a few exceptions the entire workforce ignored this unambiguous ultimatum with the result
that those who had not heeded it were again summoned to attend disciplinary hearings. They
were found guilty but again further discussions were held to ascertain whether suitable
arrangements with regard to future stay-aways could be made. When this proved to be

impossible because the workers were not prepared to commit themselves to Ahundred percent
attendance ... during any further stay-away, mass action, illegal strike and/or any planned or
unplanned work boycotts or go-slow actions@ they were dismissed.
Not one of the stay-aways had anything to do with working conditions or with anything
that Benicon had done or not done. On 3 and 4 August the workers took part in action called for
by the tripartite ANC/COSATU/SACP alliance to protest against the collapse of the CODESA
constitutional negotiations.   The evidence on this point is clear, coming as it does from the
respondents= own witness, Van Castle.   He testified that approximately 100% of the employees
in the area supported the stay-away.   Other strategies to exert political pressure on the then
government were discussed, but the Alliance decided upon that particular stay-away. Frank
Boshielo, a secretary of Numsa in the region, testifying on behalf of the respondents, confirmed
that the stay-away of 3 and 4 August 1992 was organised from June 1992 onwards by the
Alliance.   The looming stay-away was discussed with the employers in the region, inter alia the
Chamber of Commerce, Escom and Highveld Steel.   He testified as follows :

AThe Chamber of Commerce requested us that are we able or
could we be able to call off the matter at our region.   We said that
- our answer was that we can=t say anything because it=s a matter
which is from the national level.@

It is quite plain, therefore, that nothing that Benicon could do, could induce the workers to work
on 3 and 4 August. At the tentberaad it proposed  as a compromise that the workers work  on
Saturday, 1 August or Sunday, 2 August in order to build up a stockpile or that they provide a
skeleton staff on 3 and 4 August. As will presently appear, this came to nought.
[4] With this in mind I proceed to deal with Cameron J=s reasons seriatim.
[5] Ad 1
As  appears from 129D of the Court a quo=s judgment, the possibility of confusion was
mentioned in argument. But it did not form part of the respondents= statement of case that the

workers were confused at any stage, and not one of their witnesses testified that he or she was
uncertain of Benicon=s stance in respect of the stay-away of 3 and 4 August. Moreover, I fail to
see how they could have been after receipt of the notices of 19 June and 31 July. As Cameron J
himself said at 129G-H,
A[t]he 19 June memorandum was placed in every worker=s pay-packet.
Whatever its provenance and purport, it contained a clear warning that
management, whether consistently or inconsistently, and whether in
justifiable response to the breach of an agreement or not, proposed in
future to apply >disciplinary action= against workers who took part in an
illegal strike or stay-away action.@

The learned judge held (at 129E-G) that the impression of flux is accentuated by Benicon=s
willingness to negotiate about its stay-away policy. But he lost sight of the witness Van Rooyen=s
undisputed evidence (still to be cited) that it was at the workers= request that further discussions
took place after the dismissals following upon the stay-away on 23 July. And there was in any
event no causal relationship between the so-called confusion and the workers=  ultimate
dismissal. The evidence is clear that already two or three weeks prior to 3 and 4 August 1992 the
die had been cast : there was going to be a stay-away during the week commencing on Monday,
3 August.
[6] Ad 2
In my view, the finding by Cameron J that management was in central measure
responsible for the breakdown in communications and that ... its liaison committee ...  initiative
was naïve in its conception and misdirected in its execution, is one that no reasonable court could
have come to.   We are not bound by it.   Because it plays a central and pivotal role in the
decision of the court a quo, the misdirection on this point flaws the decision in its entirety.
Cameron J relied on the evidence of Maduna which was to the effect that Van der Merwe
had said, in the course of the tentberaad, that the workers must form a liaison committee, and
stated that at one point Van Rooyen virtually conceded that management had taken the initiative
on this score.  But, in fact, Van Rooyen was cross-examined extensively and repetitively on this

point.   He explained over and over that after the workers had complained about a lack of
communication, the problem of communication was addressed at length.   For the sake of
completeness, I quote from the record where Van Rooyen was cross-examined by the Appellant=s
counsel :
AIs dit korrek, Meneer, dat die idee om die liaison committee te stig, dit was
Benicon bestuur se idee gewees, is dit korrek?   ---   Nie in die minste nie, mnr
die President.
Goed.   Wie se idee was dit gewees?   ---   Dit was ons almal se idee.

Wie almal?   ---   Al die mense wat by Benicon gewerk het.

Nou beskryf net asseblief >n bietjie hoe dit gekom het, hoe julle almal by daardie
idee uitgekom het?   ---   Mnr die President, ek verwys spesifiek na een van die
dissiplinêre verhore wat gehou is by ons hoofkantoor op Saterdag, die 25ste.
Ons het aan die mense voorgehou dat hulle afbetaal is as gevolg van
wegblyaksies, toe sê hulle,  >Nee, nee, nee, nee, daar moet >n manier wees om
hierdie saak uit te sorteer=.  Toe sê ons,  >Okay, wat is die - wat gaan ons doen?=
en op daardie dissiplinêre verhoor is daar toe besluit dat ons bymekaar moet kom
en hierdie probleem wat ons het uit te sorteer en ek het getuie daaroor gelewer
dat ons het gesê ons maak die deure van die ou Benicon toe en hierdie is die
nuwe Benicon en dit het toe gelei tot by die tentberaad.    Daar het ons bymekaar
gekom.   Elkeen het sy geleentheid gehad om sy sê te sê.  As hy wou praat, kon
hy praat.   Wit, swart, almal en toe is daar voorstelle op die tafel gesit en gesê
daar is >n kommunikasie probleem, ons kan nie mooi met mekaar praat nie.   Wat
gaan ons doen?   Toe is daar besluit om op elke site mense te verkies.   Hulle is
ook verkies deur die mense.   Nie een van bestuur het daar gestaan en gesê,  >Jy
moet gekies word=  of,  >Jy moet nie gekies word nie=.   Inteendeel, die
werkvloerverteenwoordigers van NUMSA was betrokke van die begin af met
hierdie ding.  Hulle het die stemme getel en vertaal, getolk.   Dis wat gebeur het.

Maar wie het nou vorendag gekom met die idee met nou >n nuwe
komitee?   Wie was die eerste wat met daardie idee vorendag gekom het?   ---
Mnr die President, die mense het vir ons gesê dat hulle het >n probleem om te
kommunikeer met bestuur.  Toe sê ek , >Nou maar hoe gaan ons met bestuur
praat?=.   >n Voorstel was dat verteenwoordigers van die site met bestuur kom
praat en hierdie hele komitee idee was verfyn met die bespreking wat ons met die
mense gehad het.   Hulle het saamgestem dat die verskillende sites se probleme is
anderste.   Jy het die padmakers, jy het die ouens wat die klippe grou.   Jy het
ouens wat met bulldozers by Landau werk, so elkeen se situasie was anderste en
op daardie vergadering het ons gesê, >Nou, maar as elke site sy mense - sy
verteenwoordigers verkies om daardie site se probleme na bestuur toe te bring,
dan gaan dit die probleem soveel makliker maak=,  want hulle probleme is nie
almal dieselfde nie en dit is op die tafel gesit en almal het saamgestem en toe is
die persone verkies.

Mnr Van Rooyen, dit is waar, nie waar nie, dat die idee van >n
afsonderlike komitee wat gekies moet word, dit het van bestuur se kant af gekom,
korrek?   ---   Mnr die President, dit was nie >n bestuur gedrewe ding nie.

in daardie - in daardie tent op die 28ste, die mense is nie aan hulle neuse
rondgelei nie.   Glad nie.   Daardie dinge is saam besluit en dinge waaroor ons
saamgestem het, het hulle hulle hande in die lug ingesteek, die teken gegee,

werkers het vir ons gesê daar is >n probleem om met ons te praat.   Ons het nie
gesê, >Stig >n nuwe komitee=  nie of,  >Moenie met die unie praat nie=.   Nooit nie.
Inteendeel al die mense, ek dink die meeste van die mense wat verkies was op
daardie werkerskomitee of - was mense wat shop stewards was.   Die enigste
verskil was dat die mense wat verkies was, kom uit die site uit.   Dis die mense
saam met wie hulle werk en wie hulle ken.    Nou ek sou geen rede sien hoekom,
as die shop stewards verkies was voor die tyd - ek dink daar is getuienis gelewer
dat daar in 1991 al shop stewards was, dat hulle nie weer sou verkies nie, want
dis mense wat tog saam met hulle werk.   Bestuur vat nie krediet vir daardie
besluit nie, omdat dit nie bestuur se besluit was nie.   Dit was >n besluit van die
mense.@

On the probabilities, Van Rooyen=s evidence is clearly preferable to that of Maduna : the
shop stewards were present throughout the proceedings and would surely not have accepted any
proposal by management inimical to the interests of the Union, but they would have bowed to a
proposal coming from the workers themselves. Moreover, the letter handed to management by
the two head office representatives, Mapanga and Thabethe, after their visit to the Union and
after consultation with the workers reads as  follows :

ATo Benicon Management

We have now decided to withdraw from the position of representing the workers.
We
feel that to be in the committee is too demanding.
We have informed the people and they are still going to decide on that issue of
the new names but they are happy with the withdrawal.

The proposal of the people is that if you wish to see us, we will have the
following names (1) David   (2) Leonard (3) Obed   (4)   Adries

Regards@

The point is that the proposal of the four new names, coming now from the workers
acting on their own, sidelines the Union and in fact proposes a new liaison committee.   It is
ironic that the Leonard referred to is, according to Van Rooyen=s uncontested evidence, Leonard
Mapanga and the David referred to is David Thabethe, the two former members of the Aliaison
committee@at head office who stated in the very same letter that they were finding the work on
the committee too demanding!
Had the court a quo taken a balanced view of the evidence as a whole, it should clearly
have found that the probabilities favour Van Rooyen=s evidence; or, at the very  least, that it
could not decide the issue either way.
Two further points emerge from this analysis. The first is that whoever took the initiative
in the formation of the committee, it was the workers who terminated the communication
established by the committee. Secondly, after the breakdown, the representatives of the workers
communicated with Van Rooyen.   The latter=s undisputed evidence is that subsequent to the
dissolution of the workers= committee, the shop stewards informed Benicon that the workers

were not prepared to make up for loss of production, either before or after 3 and 4 August,
nor were they prepared to constitute a skeleton staff on these two days to maintain essential
services.  This evidence is  not mentioned in Cameron J=s judgment. Its importance is evident:
whether or not the Union was present and involved, the stay-way would have gone ahead and no
accommodation, such as sought by Benicon, would have been forthcoming.. The whole furore
about whose idea the formation of the liaison committee was, is thus causally irrelevant.
[7] Ad 3
To say that the withdrawal of the workers did not involve a fight to the death because the
stay-away was designed to be incidental and limited, misses the central point of the dispute.
Between 16 June 1992 and 4 August 1992 Benicon had suffered three illegal stay-aways.   The
proposals for a compromise  -  stockpiling before a stay-away, a skeleton staff on the day of the
stay-away  -   were not accepted.   There was  deadlock on a matter vital to Benicon.   It then
sought from the workers an undertaking not to participate in illegal stay-aways.   The workers=
refusal to commit themselves was the immediate, direct and effective cause of the dismissal.
The crux of this case is thus, simply, whether the demand by Benicon that the workers
undertake not to participate in future illegal stay-aways, was reasonable or not.  If not, that is the
end of the matter.   If the demand was reasonable, was the refusal to give the undertaking
reasonable and did it justify dismissal?
[8] Ad 4
To say  that Benicon seems to have dismissed the workers not for participation in the stay
away  but for refusing to agree to work on future stay-aways again misses the point. The
uncontested fact is that the workers were found guilty of illegally staying-away from work on 3
and 4 August. Negotiations then took place regarding the proper sanction.   When Benicon=s
demand, discussed in the previous paragraph, was not met, the workers were dismissed.   This is
not unusual or unknown in labour disputes, nor is it unreasonable.
[9] I turn to consider the two questions which I regard to be the real important ones.
[10]       Was the demand by Benicon that the workers undertake not to participate in
future illegal stay-aways reasonable?

In my view, no court of law can find that such a demand was unreasonable.   To do so
would be to undermine the very ethos which a court is required to uphold and to protect.   It
would undermine the very conception of a state built on the idea of justice and would play havoc
with the whole field of labour law and  of the sanctity of contracts lawfully entered into.   I need
say no more than to emphasise that during the later negotiations Numsa conceded that Benicon=s
demand was reasonable.
[11] Was the refusal of the employees of Benicon to accede to Benicon=s request
reasonable?
The converse of the finding that Benicon=s request was reasonable is that a refusal by the
other contracting parties to agree to it, was unreasonable.   To state the obvious : the refusal of
the employees to agree to a regime of non-participation in illegal stay-aways, inexorably implies
an intention to take part in illegal action against the employer.   The law cannot countenance such
an attitude.
[12]       However, the conclusions reached in the two preceding paragraphs do not inevitably
mean that the employer was entitled to dismiss the employees who stayed away on 3 and 4
August 1992 and who refused to give the above-mentioned undertaking.   The ultimate question
is one of fairness to both sides.
[13]      It must be said in favour of the workers that they found themselves in an invidious
position.  At that time in our history  -  1992  -   membership  of one of the Alliance parties
exacted a high degree of solidarity with and obedience to Alliance orders.   Even if the workers
knew that their actions were illegal and could lead to disciplinary action  - as they did in this case
- there was very little they could do about it.   It is not even necessary to count in their favour a
subjective belief in the legitimacy of their actions  - sympathy for their plight speaks objectively
from the facts. On the other hand Benicon had valid and enforceable contracts with the workers
which the latter had unlawfully breached. The company had pressing obligations  towards its
clients and the workers were informed on more than one occasion of its plight and of the
consequences of a stay-away. They chose to be loyal to a political alliance, rather than to their
employer.
[14] In favour of Benicon it must be said that it is difficult to point to any unreasonable

or unfair act or omission leading up to the eventual dismissal.   On the contrary, one gets the
impression of an employer leaning over backwards to accommodate the interests of its
employees.   I mention some of these facts :
(a)
The first important relevant fact, not dealt with by Cameron J and
my brother Farlam, is that Benicon throughout the events
culminating in the dismissal of the Respondents, never refused to
co-operate with Numsa, despite the fact that it always queried
Numsa=s authority to act on behalf of employees outside the metal
industry.   Not one of the respondents= witnesses gave an inkling
of a negative attitude on the part of Benicon towards Numsa and
Van Rooyen=s evidence of the positive attitude of Benicon was
never disputed.   This factor is relevant, not only as regards
Benicon=s attitude and fairness in respect of the dismissal of its
employees, but also in respect of the events at the tentberaad and
the succeeding days.

(b)
Another vital fact not considered in their judgments by Cameron J
or my brother Farlam, is that Benicon differentiated between the
stay-away on 16 June 1992 (Soweto Day) and the stay-aways on
23 July and 3 and 4 August 1992. Van Rooyen=s uncontradicted
evidence,  was that Benicon understood the importance of Soweto
Day and agreed to a A ... no work, no pay, no discipline ... A regime
for that day.   But the latter stay-aways were of a different kind
altogether.   The stay-away of 23 July took the form of a mass
march to the office of the  Receiver of Revenue at Witbank and to
this day no explanation has been given or even suggested for this
action.   The stay-away on 3 and 4 August was manifestly
politically inspired.   In my view, it was quite proper and
reasonable for Benicon to differentiate between the events of 16
June and those of 23 July and 3 and 4 August.

(c)
Another relevant factor in judging the fairness of the dismissal,
and not mentioned in the judgments of Cameron J and my brother
Farlam, is the remarkably accommodating and supportive attitude
and actions of Benicon towards its employees even in a conflict
situation.Time and again - on Monday, 27 July and on
Wednesday, 5 August - the employees were excused from work to
enable them to go home to prepare for the disciplinary hearing the
next day.   This, surely, is not the attitude of an employer bent on
getting rid of its employees in an unfair manner.

(d)
On 3 and 4 August 63 workers turned up for work.   They had
experienced no intimidation, and, because Benicon had made
provision for transport for all workers, they did not experience
transport problems.  Proper weight should be given to this
uncontradicted evidence.

(e)
A meeting took place on 7 August.  Mr Mashego from Numsa was
present, as were the shop stewards and representatives of
management.   The workers and Mr Mashego did not come
forward with any proposals, but requested Benicon to send its
proposals to the Union for discussion.   After the meeting ended,
Mr van Rooyen faxed a letter to Numsa (still on 7 August),
containing a draft proposed agreement regarding stay-aways/mass
action.  The Union was requested to meet urgently with Benicon
who proposed a meeting for the next day, Saturday, 8 August.
The reason for the urgency was that all Benicon operations had
come to a standstill.   The draft agreement contained proposals
aimed at getting discussions started.  The demand by the union
that Benicon must undertake to guarantee 100% safety for

workers coming to work on stay-away days was not acceptable to
Benicon, because it could not guarantee the safety of the workers
living in the townships.   The demand was also seen by Benicon
as irrelevant, because there had been no violence or intimidation
on 3 and 4 August.   Nevertheless, the Union resolutely persisted
in its demand for 100% security.   It also flatly refused to permit
any workers to turn up for work on stay-away days.

(f)
A further meeting took place on 10 August.   Two union
representatives, Mashego and Ntleko, and all the shop stewards
were present.   The company=s proposal  was to be the starting
point of the negotiations, viz an undertaking by the employees
never to participate in illegal strikes or stay-aways.   Maduna
testified that the employees required 100% security if that was to
be the case.   They also insisted on @  ... no work, no pay, no
discipline... A  Maduna conceded that it was possible that the
Union=s representative, Mr Mashijo, threatened that Numsa would
see to it that Benicon becomes isolated, locally, nationally and
internationally.  He doesn=t remember but does not deny Mr
Mashijo threat to get his Frelimo friends to subvert Benicon=s
contacts in Mozambique.   Neither can he remember Mr  van
Rooyen almost begging them to come to some sort of an
agreement.    This was in fact Van Rooyen=s evidence.   Maduna
agreed that it is possible that at that meeting the workers were
shown letters by Amcoal and Optimum Colliery addressed to
Benicon to show the seriousness of the situation.   He remembers
the Amcoal letter.   He reiterated that there was no proposal by the
Union to work in before or after a stay-away; they proposed 100%
work security.   Absolute deadlock was reached.

(g)
At the same time an offer was made to all workers to re-apply for
employment; those who did apply were appointed.  They signed
the company=s contract containing an undertaking not to
participate in illegal strikes and stay-aways.   Mr van Rooyen=s
evidence that this condition, discussed before and after 10 August
1992 with Numsa representatives, and that it was never described
by the latter as unacceptable was not challenged.

(h)
Benicon was under great pressure from its clients to secure a
continuous flow of coal.   Failure to do so could have dire
consequences for the continued existence of Benicon  - and  the
continued employment of its workers.

[15] It was argued for the respondents and is accepted by my learned brother Farlam that
Benicon should have given the employees a further chance by placing them on final warning.
But it must be remembered that since 16 June 1992 three stay-aways had occurred; that Benicon
could not continue on this basis with its mining operations; that a deadlock on the issue of stay-
aways had occurred; and that there were no practical or feasible proposals coming from the union
or the employees.
[16]        It has been aptly said that it
A ... does not mean that a dismissal cannot be justified whenever it is possible to
point to one or other course which the employer (or both parties) might have
taken, but failed to take.   A stage is reached when fairness dictates that dismissal
is justifiable.   In the course of the negotiations and power-play leading up to that
stage the options and alternatives open to both parties are no doubt numerous and
varied.   The inquiry is not whether one or other course may have been more
successful in resolving the dispute or whether the employer could have endured
the strike for longer; the inquiry is whether in all the circumstances (including, for
example, the duration of the strike and the extent of the measures actually taken

by the parties to resolve the dispute) the dismissal can be said to have been
unfair.@
(Scott JA in National Union of Mineworkers v Black Mountain Mineral Development Co (Pty)
Ltd 1997 (4) SA 51 (SCA) at 61 G - I.)   In my view, such a time had arrived in the present case.
Even if a further written ultimatum had been given, the employees would, under the same
circumstances that prevailed on 23 July 1992 or 3 and 4 August 1992, again have stayed away
without a prior stockpiling.   No evidence was offered that a further warning would have changed
the attitude of the employees.  The evidence suggests the contrary.   The parties had clearly
reached the end of the line.   In this respect, the findings made by my brother Zulman in Duke
and Others v Nasionale Sweiswerke (Pty) Ltd 1998 (3) SA 956 (SCA) at 969 C - I are
particularly apt and applicable to the present appeal.   Dealing with a comparable
matter, he concluded at 969 H - I
AOne must, of course, not lose sight of the important fact that the relevant events
occurred in difficult political times.   However, respondent was not insensitive to
this.   It agreed to absence on 3 and 4 August and took no disciplinary steps in
regard to absence on 6 and 7 August.   Bearing in mind that the required value
judgment in such cases seeks to achieve fairness to both sides, it could hardly
have been expected of respondent to continue indefinitely accepting the burden of
mass absence or mass demonstration whenever political motives came to the
fore.@

A similar approach was followed by this Court in the judgment of my Nienaber JA
(concurred in by Marais JA and Zulman JA) in National Union of Metalworkers of SA v Vetsak
Co-operative Ltd and Others 1996 (4) SA 562 (A) at 602 A - B
AVetsak could not know, at the time of making the decisions to issue and
implement the ultimatum, for how long it would find itself either without any
labour or with only >scab= labour.   Such labour can generate its own peculiar set
of disruptive problems.   It seems to me that if the initial decision to issue an
ultimatum was fair in all the circumstances, as I think was in this case, an
employer cannot be criticised, if his employees remain recalcitrant, from

implementing it.   And that, unpalatable as it may be to them, is a consequence of
their own conduct which employees must be prepared to face.  A

In my view the appeal should succeed with costs. The court a quo=s order should be
amended to read AAppeal dismissed with costs@.

SOUTH AFRICAN REVENUE SERVICES

Coram:   Hefer, Grosskopf, Zulman, JJA, Melunsky and  Farlam AJJA

Heard:    2 September 1999

Delivered: 1 October 1999

Value-added tax - zero rating - Rugby World Cup tickets sold overseas.

J U D G M E N T

F H  GROSSKOPF JA/ . . .

F H GROSSKOPF J A:
[1]     The appellant (ASarfu@) claimed a refund of value-added tax (AVAT@) in
terms of s 44 of the Value-Added Tax Act 89 of 1991. The respondent refused to
make any refund and disallowed  Sarfu=s objection to his decision.  Sarfu thereupon
lodged an appeal to the Transvaal Income Tax Special Court.  That court dismissed
the appeal but granted leave to appeal to this court.
[2]     The dispute arose from the presentation in South Africa during 1995 of the
Rugby World Cup Tournament (Athe tournament@).    This took place in terms of a
written agreement (Athe agreement@) concluded during July 1993 by Rugby World
Cup Limited (Athe Central Organiser@), Rugby World Cup (Licensing) BV (ARWC
(L) BV@) and  Sarfu.   The agreement granted the Central Organiser, a company
incorporated under the laws of  and having its principal place of business on the
Isle of Man, the right to stage the tournament in South Africa.  RWC (L) BV,  a
Dutch company with its principal place of business in Rotterdam, acquired the

right to exploit the commercial rights in respect of the tournament. Sarfu, as the
Host Union, undertook to make all the arrangements for the matches to be played.
In return it would receive a management fee and a share of the profits.
[3]      The arrangements for the matches included the printing of tickets but the
Central Organiser had the final say over the ticketing policy.   A separate
Ticketing Policy Booklet (Athe booklet@) allotted up to 50% of the tickets for each
match to the Central Organiser for the overseas market.   ( I shall refer to these
tickets as Athe overseas tickets@.)    The overseas tickets were divided equally
amongst the Central Organiser,  RWC (L) NV and the official tour operator
(AGullinjet@).    Sarfu agreed to provide the Central Organiser with a total
breakdown of all tickets available within each venue at which a match or matches
would be played during the tournament whereupon the Central Organiser was
entitled and obliged to specify the number of tickets it  required in respect of each
match.

[4]     According to a document titled ATicket Reconciliation for VAT purposes@
prepared by Sarfu=s chartered accountants Coopers & Lybrand, 109 050 overseas
tickets were eventually disposed of for a total amount of R13 192 900,00.     20 538
of these were sent by courier to the Central Organiser at its London address.  Their
rand value, calculated according to their selling price to the eventual ticketholders,
amounted to R2 324 970,00.  This amount was debited to the Central Organiser=s
loan account. The other overseas tickets were collected from Sarfu by
representatives of RWC (L) NV and Gullinjet in Johannesburg against payment of
the selling price of those tickets.  This was done to facilitate Sarfu=s administrative
responsibilities.
[5]      VAT was paid on the amount of R13 192 900,00 in terms of S 7(1)(a) of the
Act which read as follows at the relevant time:
A(1)
Subject to the exemptions, exceptions, deductions and adjustments
provided for in this Act, there shall be levied and paid for the benefit of
the State Revenue Fund a tax, to be known as the value-added tax -
(a)
on the supply by any vendor of goods or services supplied

by him on or after the commencement date in the course
or furtherance of any enterprise carried on by him;
(b)
.....
(c)
.....

calculated at the rate of 14 per cent on the value of the supply concerned ....@.
[6]       Before I deal with the argument for Sarfu in support of its claim for a refund
two preliminary observations are called for. The first is that the VAT was paid by
ASARFU RWC 1995"", a so-called Aclub@ which was registered under that name as a
Avendor@ in  terms of the Act.  In the application for registration of SARFU RWC
1995 the Central Organiser and Sarfu were described as Apartners@ of a joint
venture whose address was given as Ellis Park Stadium, Doornfontein in
Johannesburg. The respondent does not object to the fact that Sarfu is claiming the
refund.
[7]     The second observation is that members of this court mero motu raised the
question whether the supply of the overseas tickets was taxable at all and if so,
whether the tax was levied on the correct amount.  Counsel for the respondent

informed us that  the respondent had not considered these matters since Sarfu had
never raised them, but that the respondent would abide the decision of the court.
Later in this judgment  I will deal more fully with this aspect of the matter but,
because part of the reasoning in that regard also applies to the question of zero
rating,  it is convenient to say at this stage that it is quite clear that the overseas
tickets never belonged to Sarfu and that Sarfu delivered but did not sell them to the
Central Organiser and the other two entities.   When it was put in  cross-
examination to Mr Oberholzer who testified for Sarfu in the court a quo  that the
Central Organiser had in effect purchased the tickets from Sarfu he rightly
answered:
ADit was hulle eie kaartjies gewees.  Hulle kon dit nie by ons gekoop het
nie.@

Since the parties never intended the overseas tickets to be sold to and purchased by
the Central Organiser and the other two entities  a basic requirement of a sale was
lacking (McAdams v Fiander=s Trustee & Bell NO 1919 AD 207 at 223-224).

[8]     Sarfu=s case is that the supply of  overseas tickets to the Central Organiser
and the other two entities should have been zero rated. It relies on three subsections
of the Act.
[9]      The first subsection  is s 11(1)(a), a provision dealing with a supply of
goods. At the relevant time it read as follows:
A(1)
Where, but for the provisions of this section, a supply of goods would be
charged with tax under section 7(1)(a), such supply of goods shall,
subject to compliance with subsection (3) of this section, be charged with
tax at the rate of zero per cent where -
(a)
the supplier has supplied the goods (being
movable goods) in terms of a sale or
instalment credit agreement and has
exported the goods@.

AGoods@ is defined in s 1 of the Act as meaning -

Acorporeal movable things, fixed property and any real right in any such thing or
fixed property, but excluding  -
(a)
money;
(b)
any right under a mortgage bond or pledge of any such
thing or fixed property; and
(c)
any stamp, form or card which has a money value and has
been sold or issued by the State for the payment of any tax
or duty levied under any Act of Parliament, except when
subsequent to its original sale or issue it is disposed of or

imported as a collector=s piece or investment article@.

S 11(1)(a) however refers only to those goods which are Amovable goods@.
Although I have certain reservations I shall assume, but without deciding, that
rugby tickets are movable goods.
[10]      Sarfu relies on the provisions of s 11(1)(a) only in respect of those overseas
tickets which were dispatched to the Central Organiser in London.  It is common
cause that those tickets were not supplied in terms of an Ainstalment credit
agreement@.   The question is whether they were supplied in terms of a Asale@,
which is defined in s 1 as
Aan agreement of purchase and sale and includes any transaction or act whereby
or in consequence of which ownership of goods passes or is to pass from one
person to another@.

I have already held that the overseas tickets were not supplied in terms of an
agreement of purchase and sale and, because the Central Organiser was the owner
of those tickets all along, it is quite clear that ownership did not pass in

consequence of the transaction whereby they were dispatched to London. They
were not supplied in terms of a Asale@ as defined and  s 11(1)(a) consequently does
not assist Sarfu. In view of this finding it is unnecessary to deal with the export
requirement of the subsection.
[11]      Sarfu also calls in aid the provisions of s 11(2)(k) and (l) which deal with
the supply of services and read as follows at the relevant time:
A(2)
Where, but for this section, a supply of services would be charged with
tax under section 7(1)(a), such supply of services shall, subject to
compliance with subsection (3) of this section, be charged with tax at the
rate of zero per cent where -
. . . .

(k)
the services are physically rendered elsewhere than in the
Republic;
(l)
the services are supplied for and to a person who is not a
resident of the Republic and who is outside the Republic
at the time the services are rendered . . . .@

Par (k) is again relied on only in respect of the overseas tickets which were
provided to the Central Organiser itself.  The submission is that the actual handing
over of these overseas tickets in London constituted a physical rendering of

services elsewhere than in the Republic. The short answer is that Sarfu, who bears
the onus in terms of s 37,  has not shown that the courier who delivered the tickets
in London was acting as its (Sarfu=s) agent and not as the agent of the Central
Organiser.  At best for Sarfu the evidence is  inconclusive with the result that there
is no proof that the vendor  physically rendered any services outside the Republic.
[12]      For the  argument founded on the provisions of s 11(2)(l) it is submitted
that the services (i e the actual handing over of the tickets) were supplied for and to
the Central Organiser, for and to RWC (L) NV and for and to Gullinjet who were
not residents of the Republic and who were outside the Republic at the time the
services were rendered.
In considering the provision of s 11(2)(l) it is necessary to look at the
definition of Aresident of the Republic@ in s 1 of the Act.  It means -
Aa person (other than a company) who is ordinarily resident in the Republic or a
company which is a domestic company as defined in section 1 of the Income Tax
Act:  Provided that any other person or any other company shall be deemed to be
a resident of the Republic to the extent that such person or company carries on in

the Republic any enterprise or other activity and has a fixed or permanent place
in the Republic relating to such enterprise or other activity@.

In my view Sarfu has failed to prove that the three entities were not residents of the
Republic at the time.  On the contrary, the probabilities are overwhelming that each
of them at the very least conducted its own activity and had a fixed place within the
Republic relating thereto.  The Central Organiser was indeed a member of the joint
venture (SARFU RWC 1995) which was registered as a vendor in terms of the Act
and plainly carried on an enterprise for some time before and during the course of
the tournament with a fixed place of business at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.
Gullinjet=s letterheads show that a company, Gullinjet Sport Travel (Pty) Ltd, with
two South African directors, had a fixed place of business at Standard Bank Centre
in Cape Town from where it carried on an enterprise as the official tour operator
for Rugby World Cup South Africa 1995. The position of RWC (L) NV is not so
clear, but it certainly was physically represented in South Africa through accredited
employees and agents to enable it  to carry on its business of exploiting commercial

rights at the various venues in South Africa for the duration of the tournament. (Cf
Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Actiengesellschaft für Motor und
Motorfahrzeugbau Vorm.  Cudell & Co [1902] 1KB 342(CA).)
[13]      Since the very first requirement of par (l) has thus not been met it is not
necessary to deal with the requirement of actual absence from the Republic.
[14]      For these reasons neither par (k) nor par (l) of s 11(2) applies.  Sarfu=s
submission that the supply of the overseas tickets had to be zero rated cannot be
sustained.
[15]      Having disposed of the grounds on which Sarfu has claimed a refund, I
revert to the question whether the supply of the overseas tickets attracted any tax at
all and, if so, whether the tax was levied on the correct amount.
[16]        Much time was spent at the hearing of the appeal on a debate about the
real nature of the overseas tickets in order to ascertain whether they can be
classified as Agoods@. It was largely a fruitless debate because, in regard to the

questions with which we are now concerned,  it makes no difference whether Sarfu
in fact supplied Agoods@ or whether it supplied Aservices@. And, since I have been
persuaded that  it did indeed supply Aservices@, I will not waste further energy on
the subject of Agoods@.
[17]      According to s 1 of the Act  Aservices@ means -
Aanything done or to be done, including the granting, assignment, cession or
surrender of any right or the making available of any facility or advantage, but
excluding a supply of goods, money or any stamp, form or card contemplated in
paragraph (c) of the definition of  >goods= @.

As respondent=s counsel pointed out Sarfu arranged for the printing of the tickets ,
collected them and kept them in safe custody,  and eventually handed them over to
the Central Organiser and the other two entities and received and retained the
proceeds for subsequent distribution in terms of the agreement. I accept that all this
constituted the supply of Aservices@.
[18]      But in terms of s 7(1)(a) the tax has to be calculated on the Avalue of the
supply concerned@ and s 10(2) provided at the relevant time that

AThe value to be placed on any supply of goods or services shall, save as is
otherwise provided in this section, be the value of the consideration for such
supply, as determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (3), . . .@ .
(My emphasis.)
I need not dwell on the provisions of ss (3) because in the present case the value
was simply taken to be the total selling price of all the overseas tickets, ie
R13 192 900,00 which, as respondent=s counsel rightly conceded,  was plainly not
Athe value of the supply concerned@. Bearing in mind that Sarfu supplied the
services in connection with the overseas tickets in compliance with its obligations
under the agreement I am far from convinced that it was supposed to receive, or in
fact did  receive,  any consideration for that service. And even if it did, its
consideration certainly bore no relation to the selling price of the tickets.
[19]      What now remains is to decide how to rectify the position. It is plain that
the value to be placed on the supply of services by Sarfu in respect of the overseas
tickets will have to be determined and the tax reassessed. It is equally plain that the
amount of any overpayment made to the respondent must be refunded. The order

that I am about to make, including the order that each party is to pay his own costs
of the appeal, ought to do justice to both sides.
The following order is made:
1.
The appeal is allowed but each party is to pay his own costs.
2.
The order of the court a quo confirming the assessment is set aside and replaced
by the following order:
A(1)
The Commissioner is to reassess the Value Added Tax payable by
SARFU RWC 1995 on its supply of services in respect of the tickets sold
overseas;
(2)
The Commissioner is to pay SARFU the balance between the amount of
R1 569 490,62 previously paid and the amount of the reassessed tax.@

JUDGMENT

MAHOMED CJ/
MAHOMED CJ
The appellant instituted an action against the respondent in the court a quo for the
payment of damages suffered by her as a result of the death of the deceased in a motor car
accident.  From the pleadings and the agreed statement in terms of Rule 33(1) the following
appear as common cause between the parties:

(a)
The deceased died in a motor collision on 25 July 1993 between a Toyota
Abakkie@ driven by one M Biyela and an Opel Monza driven by the deceased.
(b)
The sole cause of this collision was the negligent driving of Biyela.
(c)
The deceased and the appellant were married according to Islamic Law on  18
April 1987.
(d)
AIn terms of their Islamic marriage, which is a contract, the deceased as husband
was obliged to maintain and support the [appellant] during the course of the
marriage and until termination thereof by death or divorce and in fact did so.@
(e)
The Islamic marriage between the appellant and the deceased was not registered
as a civil marriage in terms of the provisions of the Marriage Act of 1961.

(f)
The appellant duly lodged a claim against the respondent for compensation for
loss of support by reason of the death of the deceased pursuant to the provisions
of Article 62 of the Agreement establishing the Multilateral Motor Vehicle
Accidents Fund Act 93 of 1989.
(g)
The respondent did not object to the procedural validity of this claim or to the
claim made on behalf of the children of the marriage but it nevertheless
repudiated the appellant=s own claim for loss of support.

On these facts the court a quo was required to resolve the following issue:

AIs the [respondent] legally liable to compensate [the appellant] for loss of
support of her deceased husband to whom she was married by Islamic
Rites?@

The court a quo (per Meskin J) answered that question in the negative, but Counsel
appearing before us on appeal were agreed that if it was wrong in that conclusion, the appellant

was entitled to judgment in the sum of R 250 000 which was the agreed sum of damages suffered
by her in consequence of the loss of her husband=s support.

Before the present appeal was heard, the Commission for Gender Equality applied to be
and was admitted as an amicus curiae.  It was represented at the hearing by Mr M Chaskalson
(with him Miss A Kalla) both acting pro amico and the Court wishes to express its appreciation
to Counsel for the full and competent arguments which they advanced in support of their
submissions.

Both Mr Omar who appeared for the appellant and Mr Chaskalson contended that on a
proper analysis of the existing relevant common law rules of application, a claim for loss of
support made on behalf of a Muslim widow in the position of the appellant, is sound in law.  In
the alternative it was submitted that, if the existing state of the common law did not support such
a claim, the common law should properly be developed to accommodate the claim in terms of
section 35(3) of the interim Constitution, Act 200 of 1993 (which was of application when the
action in the court a quo commenced).

The Historical Origins and Evolution of the Dependant=s Action in the Common Law
The death of a breadwinner who has a duty to support the dependants of the breadwinner
undoubtedly causes loss to such dependants.  These dependants should in equity therefore be
able to recover such loss from a party who has unlawfully caused the death of the breadwinner
by any act of negligence or other wrongful conduct.  This is the rationale for the dependant=s
action.  That remedy was unknown in Roman Law.  It came however to be recognised and firmly
entrenched in Roman Dutch Law, under the influence of the Germanic custom concerning the
institution of the zoengeld and the philosophy of natural law as developed by medieval and
sixteenth century theologians.1  It constitutes the juristic basis for any claim which the appellant
might have against Biyela and therefore against the respondent which is only obliged to
compensate the dependants of a deceased for losses suffered by them in consequence of a motor
accident caused by the negligent or other unlawful conduct of the driver of the relevant motor

vehicle, if such a driver would have been liable for such losses at common law.2

Mlisane v South African Eagle Insurance Co Ltd 1996 (3) SA 36 (C) at 40 I-J.

The precise scope of the dependant=s action is unclear from the writings of the old Roman
Dutch Jurists.  De Groot extends it to Athose whom the deceased was accustomed to aliment ex
officio, for example his parents, his widow, his children . . . .@3  This and other passages in De
Groot=s writings perhaps support his suggestion that the action was competent at the instance of
any dependant within his broad family whom he in fact supported whether he was obliged to do
so or not but this is unclear.4  The same uncertainty but tendency to extend the dependant=s action
to any dependant enjoying a de facto close familial relationship with the breadwinner is also
manifest in Voet 9.2.11 who seeks to accord the dependant=s action to the breadwinner=s, Awife,
children and the like@ (Auxori, liberis, similibusque@).5

What the old writers appear anxious to recognise is that members of the family of the
deceased had a right to enforce a claim for the loss of such support resulting from the death of

De Jure Belli ac Pacis 2.17.13 translated by Feenstra in 1972 Acta Juridica 234.  The phrase
Aex officio@ is not translated or explained by Feenstra but it is translated by Francis W Kelsey
as describing the obligation which the deceased had towards those whom he Awas accustomed
to support from a sense of duty ....@ Hugo Grotius The Law of War and Peace translated by
FW Kelsey at p 434.
See the judgment of Nienaber JA in Santam Bpk v Henery (above note 1) at 426.  De Groot:

the deceased (or injury to him) caused by the unlawful acts of the defendant. This was a right
worthy of public recognition and protection by the law.

For this reason the Court in Union Government (Minister of Railways and Harbours) v
Warneke6 was able to recognise the dependant=s claim of a husband for the loss of support of his
wife.  The Court recognised that no dependant=s action at the instance of the husband was
mentioned in the old authorities, but this was because Ait never occurred to the jurists of the
seventeenth century to extend this remedy to a husband.@  It was held that there was no reason
why our courts should not adapt the Lex Aquilia to the conditions of modern life, in this respect
Aas far as that can be done without doing violence to its principles.@7

1911 AD 657.
Innes J in Union Government v Warneke above note 6 at 664-5.

Two important propositions appear clearly from the case of Union
Government v Warneke.  The first is that the dependant=s action was a flexible
remedy, which needed to be adapted to modern conditions.  The second is that in
determining the process of adaptation regard had to be had to the rationale for the
remedy, which was to afford relief to dependants whom the deceased had a legal
duty to support, even if the duty arose out of natural law.  Considerations of equity
and decency informed the duty of support in Roman Dutch Law.8

Langemaat v Minister of Safety and Security and Others 1998 (3) SA 312 (T) at 316 E-F.

The flexibility of the dependant=s action has since the case of Union Government v
Warneke, repeatedly been utilized to afford the benefit of the remedy to classes not expressly
mentioned in the old authorities.  In Abbot v Bergman9 it was extended to accommodate the
claim of a husband for the loss of support of his injured wife.  In Santam Bpk v Henery10 it was
used to uphold the claim of a divorcee who was not even married to the deceased at the time of
the death of the deceased but was receiving maintenance payments from him pursuant to an order
of maintenance made in Court and in Zimnat Insurance Co Ltd v Chawanda11 the Supreme Court
of Zimbabwe held that a widow married to the deceased by African Customary law was also
entitled to the protection of the dependant=s action.

Santam Bpk v Henery is the most recent reported decision of this Court relevant to the
proper approach to be adopted in assessing the validity of a dependant=s claim for loss of support.
The judgment of Nienaber JA who wrote on behalf of a unanimous Court manifests the

1922 AD 53.
Above note 1.
1991 (2) SA 825 (ZS).

following:12

(a)
The claimant for loss of support resulting from the unlawful killing of the
deceased must establish that the deceased had a duty to support the dependant.
(b)
It had to be a legally enforceable duty.

Henery above note 1 at 427 H-J; 429 C-D; 430 D-I.
(c)
The right of the dependant to such support had to be worthy of protection by the
law.
(d)
The preceding element had to be determined by the criterion of boni mores.
(e)
Thus approached, the claim of a widow who had been divorced at the date of the
death of the deceased but who had been entitled to support from him, by virtue of
an order of maintenance made by a Court, could be accommodated within the
legitimate parameters of the dependant=s action in the common law because:

i
the deceased had a duty to support the claimant who was his
former wife;
ii.
that duty was legally enforceable;
iii.
the right of the former wife to such support was a right which was
worthy of protection by the law, for the purposes of the
dependant=s action; and
iv.
the last assessment was justified by the criterion of boni mores.

On the approach adopted above, it accordingly becomes necessary to determine whether
the claim of the appellant in the present matter satisfies the relevant tests which have to be
applied in assessing its legal legitimacy.

The first requirement in paragraph [12] appears clearly to be satisfied, because the agreed
statement between the parties records that the deceased had a duty to support the appellant Ain
terms of the Islamic marriage which is a contract.@

Moreover, it was, in my view, a duty which was legally enforceable and therefore
satisfies the second requirement.  In his fair and able argument, Mr Pammenter SC who appeared
for the respondent properly conceded that a claim for support made by the appellant against the
deceased during the subsistence of the marriage would not be excipiable in law.  This concession
carries the necessary implication that it was legally enforceable.

It was nevertheless contended that the appellant=s claim against the respondent should fail
because:

(a)
the marriage between her and the deceased did not enjoy the status of a marriage
in the civil law;
(b)
any legal duty which the deceased had to support the appellant was therefore a
contractual consequence of the union between them and not an ex lege
consequence of the marriage per se;
(c)
the dependant=s action for loss of support was an Aanomalous@ remedy which

should not be extended to accommodate claims for loss of support undertaken
contractually but not flowing from the common law consequences of a valid
marriage.

In support of this attack on the appellant=s claim, we were referred to the case of
Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Trust en Assuransie Maatskappy Bpk v Fondo13 in which it was held
that a claim for loss of support brought against the appellant insurer by a widow of a customary
marriage between her and the deceased was bad in law.  We were also referred to cases such as
Seedat's Executors v The Master (Natal)14 and Ismail v Ismail15 in which it was held that
marriages solemnized in accordance with Islamic law only did not enjoy the status of marriage in
the civil law, because they were Apotentially polygamous.@  I have a number of difficulties with
the approach which was adopted in Fondo=s case.

My main difficulty is with the test the Court applied in assessing whether the claim for

1960 (2) SA 467 (A); also followed in Nkabinde v SA Motor & General Insurance Co Ltd
1961 (1) SA 302 (N).
1917 AD 302.

loss of support made by the widow in a customary marriage was good in law.  It was held16 that
it was not sufficient for her to establish that the deceased had a legal duty to support  her during
the subsistence of the marriage and that he in fact did so.  She had to go further and show that
she was the lawful wife of the deceased in terms of a marriage which was recognised by the
common law as a lawful marriage.  It was held that17 the widow had to fail in her claim, because
the relevant system of customary law in terms of which she was married permitted polygamy and
that fact, it was said, made her marriage invalid in the common law.

1983 (1) SA 1006 (A).
Fondo above note 13 at 473 C-D.
Fondo above note 13 at 473 E-H.

In my view the correct approach is not to ask whether the customary marriage was lawful
at common law or not but to enquire whether or not the deceased was under a legal duty to
support the appellant during the subsistence of the marriage and if so whether the  right of the
widow was in the circumstances, a right which deserved protection for the purposes of the
dependant=s action.  This is the test adopted by this Court in Santam Bpk v Henery.18

Above note 1.

The crucial question which therefore needs to be applied is whether or not the legal right
which the appellant had to support from the deceased during the subsistence of the marriage, is a
right which in the circumstances disclosed by the present case, deserves recognition and
protection by the law for the purposes of the dependant=s action.  In my view it does, if regard is
had to the fact that at the hearing before us it was common cause that the Islamic marriage
between the appellant and the deceased was a de facto monogamous marriage; that it was
contracted according to the tenets of a major religion; and that it involved Aa very public
ceremony, special formalities and onerous obligations for both parents in terms of the relevant
rules of Islamic law applicable.@19  The insistence that the duty of support which such a serious
de facto monogamous marriage imposes on the husband is not worthy of protection can only be
justified on the basis that the only duty of support which the law will protect in such
circumstances is a duty flowing from a marriage solemnized and recognised by one faith or
philosophy to the exclusion of others.  This is an untenable basis for the determination of the
boni mores of society.  It is inconsistent with the new ethos of tolerance, pluralism and religious
freedom which had consolidated itself in the community even before the formal adoption of the

Description of Islamic marriage and its consequences in Fraser v Children's Court, Pretoria
North, and Others 1997 (2) SA 261 (CC) at para 21.

interim Constitution on 22 December 1993.  The new ethos had already begun in 1989 with the
publication of the report on Group and Human Rights by the South African Law Commission,
recommending the repeal of all legislation inconsistent with a negotiated bill of fundamental
rights;20 it accelerated with the speech of the former State President on 2 February 1990 and the
unbanning and the visibility of the previously prohibited political movements and it finally
became irreversible with the commencement and conclusion of negotiations at CODESA from
1991 until 1993.  The new ethos was firmly in place when the cause of action in the present
matter arose on 25 July 1993.

Project 58.

This new ethos is substantially different from the ethos which informed the determination
of the boni mores of the community when the cases which decided that Apotentially polygamous@
marriages which did not accord with the assumptions of the culturally and politically dominant
establishment of the time did not deserve the protection of the law for the purposes of the
dependant=s action.  This is evident from the form and the language in which those assumptions
were sometimes articulated during those times.  In holding that the child of a marriage according
to Muslim law could not enjoy the status of legitimacy the Cape Supreme Court21 in 1860 had
said:

ANow marriage is a condition Divine in its institution, originating
with our first parents; therefore older than the Jewish Dispensation,
and it is only by the development of Christianity that the sacred and
mysterious union has been clearly revealed to mankind, and has
enjoined a strict observance of its requirements, and one of the first of
these requirements is, amongst all Christian nations, that polygamy is
unlawful, and that marriage is only  good when contracted with a man

Bronn v Fritz Bronn=s Executors (1860) 3 Searle 313 at 318; 320-1; and 333.  See also

who is not already married to another woman.@

Seedat=s case (above note 14) at 307-8.
A. . . I trust that in a short time . . .  the sacred institution of marriage
will be brought by some well devised law within the reach of the
people of this Colony who have not yet embraced the greater
blessings which they would  obtain by Christian marriage, by which I
mean of course marriage to one wife, which, among the heathen ought
to be sanctioned and encouraged by law.  It is, even amongst them, an
institution of a divine character - a glimmer of the light once shining
in Paradise, which is still vouchsafed to them.@

AEqually so with the Mohammedans.  If what they call marriage is not
what we call marriage, in its essential requirements, but what the
jurisprudence of even  Christian Rome under the Emperors, up to the
time of Leo the Philosopher, would call a recognised concubinage -
we cannot, because of the ambiguity of the expression, make that
marriage which is a wholly different relation.@

The contrast between the ethos which informed the assessment of boni
mores in this kind of approach and the ethos which had come to inform the same
assessment in more recent times is evident from the judgment of Farlam J in
Ryland v Edros22 where the following is stated:

1997 (2) SA 690 (C) at 707 E-H.

ACan it be said, since the coming into operation of the new
Constitution, that a contract concluded by parties which arises from a
marriage relationship entered into by them in accordance with the
rites of their religion and which as a fact is monogamous is `contrary
to the accepted customs and usages which are regarded as morally
binding upon all members of our society' or is `fundamentally
opposed to our principles and institutions'? (In each case the emphasis
is mine.)

I think not. I agree with Mr Trengove's submission that it is quite
inimical to all the values of the new South Africa for one group to
impose its values on another and that the Courts should only brand a
contract as offensive to public policy if it is offensive to those values
which are shared by the community at large, by all right-thinking
people in the community and not only by one section of it.

It is clear, in my view, that in the Ismail case the views (or presumed
views) of only one group in our plural society were taken into
account.@

I have no doubt that the boni mores of the community at the time when the cause of
action arose in the present proceedings would not support a conclusion which denies to a duty of
support arising from a de facto monogamous marriage solemnly entered into in accordance with
the Muslim faith any recognition in the common law for the purposes of the dependant=s action;
but which affords to the same duty of support arising from a similarly solemnized marriage in

accordance with the Christian faith full recognition in the same common law for the same
purpose; and which even affords to polygamous marriages solemnized in accordance with
African customary law exactly the  same protection for the same purpose, (by virtue of the
provisions of section 31 of the Black Laws Amendment Act 76 of 1963 which reverses the
consequences of the Fondo23 judgment in respect of customary marriages).  The inequality,
arbitrariness, intolerance and inequity inherent in such a conclusion would be inconsistent with
the new ethos which prevailed on 25 July 1993 when the cause of action in the present matter
commenced.  The boni mores of the community would at that time support the approach which
gave to the duty of support following on a de facto monogamous marriage in terms of the Islamic
faith the same protection of the common law for the purposes of the dependant=s action, as would
be accorded to a monogamous marriage solemnized in terms of the Christian faith.

Above note 13.

This important shift in the identifiable boni mores of the community must also manifest itself in a
corresponding evolution in the relevant parameters of application in this area.  AThe common law
is not to be trapped within the limitations of its past.@24  If it does not do this it would risk losing
the virility, relevance and creativity which it needs to retain its legitimacy and effectiveness in
the resolution of conflict between and in the pursuit of justice among the citizens of a democratic
society.  For this reason the common law constantly evolves to accommodate changing values
and new needs.25

I have deliberately emphasised in this judgment the de facto monogamous character of
the Muslim marriage between the appellant and the deceased in the present matter.  I do not
thereby wish to be understood as saying that if the deceased had been party to a plurality of
continuing unions, his dependants would necessarily fail in a dependant=s action based on any
duty which the deceased might have towards such dependants.  I prefer to leave that issue
entirely open.  Arguments arising from the relationship between the values of equality and

para [86].

v Trust Bank van Afrika Bpk 1979 (3) SA 824 (A).

religious freedom - now articulated in the Constitution but consolidated in the immediate period
preceding the interim Constitution - might influence the proper resolution of that issue.

Mr Pammenter on behalf of the respondent quite properly and frankly conceded that a
view of the common law which discriminated between marriages in terms of the Muslim religion
and marriages in terms of any other religion or faith was quite indefensible.  He argued
nevertheless that Muslim couples, like any other couples are free to solemnize their marriage in
terms of the Marriage Act, and thus acquire for their relationship the status of a civil marriage.
They therefore suffered no special discrimination on the grounds of their faith.

Although this  may not be entirely clear I shall assume that such Muslim couples would be
entitled to the solemnisation of their marriage in terms of the Marriage Act even if the husband
were to declare to the Marriage Officer that in terms of his faith he retained the right to contract a
further marriage during the existence of the marriage which was about to be solemnized and even
if the wife was to be represented as she was in this case by proxy.26

Section 29(2) of the Marriage Act 25 of 1961 provides that a marriage officer shall solemnize
any marriage in the presence of the parties themselves and at least two competent witnesses.

The assumption I have made, however, does not assist my main difficulty with the case sought to
be made on behalf of the respondent.  It is simply this: For the purposes of the dependant=s action
the decisive issue is not whether the dependant concerned was or was not lawfully married to the
deceased, but whether or not the deceased was under a legal duty to support the dependant in a
relationship which deserved recognition and protection at common law.  If the marriage between
the dependant and the deceased was a valid marriage in terms of the civil law, she would of
course have the right to pursue a dependant=s claim based on the duty of the deceased to support
her but it does not follow that if she was not so married, she should have no such right.  On the
analysis I have previously made she would indeed have such a right even if she was not validly
married to the deceased in the civil law if the deceased was under a legally enforceable
contractual duty to support her following upon a de facto monogamous marriage in accordance
with a recognised and accepted faith such as Islam.

It was suggested in argument that the recognition of a dependant=s claim which is
premised on a contractual duty might unacceptably widen the scope of the dependant=s action in

the common law.  It might indeed do so if the loss of support resulting from a contractually
enforceable duty alone was sufficient to sustain the dependant=s claim.  But this is not what I
have held.  What I have held is that the dependant must show that:

(a)
the deceased had a legally enforceable duty to support the dependant and
(b)
that it was a duty arising from a solemn marriage in accordance with the tenets of
recognised and accepted faith and
(c)
it was a duty which deserved recognition and protection for the purposes of the
dependant=s action.

The dependant concerned would not succeed by establishing (a) alone.  The requirement in (a) is
a necessary condition in terms of Warneke=s case27 but it is not a sufficient condition.

Union Government v Warneke above note 6.

It was also suggested that if a legal duty of support arising from a contractual incident of
a Muslim marriage was to be afforded recognition for the purposes of the dependant=s action, it
would also lead to a recognition of possibly other incidents of such a marriage which have
neither been articulated or properly analysed in the present appeal.  That suggestion is unsound.
It is perfectly possible to recognise one incident of such a marriage for a special purpose, without
necessarily recognising any other incident of such marriage for that purpose or any other
purpose.  This is made clear in several cases in South Africa and abroad.28

Baindail [1946] 1 All ER 342 (CA) at 346, [1946] P 122 at 128; Sinha Peerage case [1946] 1

another [1978] 3 All ER 385 (Ch).

It was also contended that if the approach adopted in Fondo=s case29 does indeed operate
harshly and inequitably on Muslim widows in the position of the appellant as I have found, the
proper remedy is for the Legislature to effect statutory redress as it in fact did in the case of
widows who had been married by African customary law.  I have no doubt that it would be
perfectly proper for the Legislature to enact such legislation if it considered it necessary, but it
does not follow that the Courts should not interpret and develop the common law to
accommodate this need if it was consistent with the relevant common law principles which
regulate the objectives and the proper ambit of the dependant=s action in Roman Dutch law. For
the reasons I have indicated it is legitimate and necessary to do so in the present matter.  The
appellant has after all waited for some six years to obtain proper compensation.  She has acted
with vigour in seeking relief in the High Court and in the Constitutional Court (which held that
she should first pursue her common law remedies before this Court before invoking the
constitutional jurisdiction of that Court).30 I do not see any reason why this Court should deny to
her the relief in common law to which she is entitled.  I think Mr Chaskalson is correct in
contending that this is not a case which involves difficult policy and political choices which

should appropriately be left to the Legislature.  Nor is there any danger that by upholding the
appellant=s claim the Court might become Aentangled@ in religiously controversial doctrines.  The
legal legitimacy of the claim can be assessed purely on the proper application of common law
principles of application to the dependant=s action without any reference to any religious doctrine
or policy.

Counsel for the respondent also relied on various dicta in the case of Ismail v Ismail31
which was decided in this Court in 1983.  Ismail=s case is distinguishable from the present appeal
because it was not concerned with a dependant=s claim at all and was in any event decided long
before the consolidation of the new ethos to which I have referred earlier.  The Court refused to
enforce certain customs which were said to flow from a de facto monogamous Islamic marriage
on the grounds that potentially polygamous marriages were contra bonos mores and that the
customs relied on were intrinsic to the potentially polygamous union between the parties. To the

extent to which these dicta are inconsistent with the approach I have articulated in this judgment,
I must express my respectful disagreement with them.
The Alternative Argument

The conclusion to which I have come is that the appellant has a good cause of action.  I
have reached that conclusion without any reliance on either section 35(3) of the interim
Constitution or section 39(2) of the 1996 Constitution.  It is therefore unnecessary for me to
consider the submission of Counsel for the appellant based on these constitutional provisions or
to consider whether either of these sections can properly be applied in respect of a cause of
action which arose before the commencement of the interim Constitution.32

Costs

Cf Du Plessis and Others v De Klerk and Another above note 24 at paras 65 and 66.

No grounds have been advanced to deny the successful party the costs that she has
incurred in pursuing her claim in this Court.

Order

In the result I make the following order:

1)
The order made by Meskin J in the court a quo on 1 December 1997 is
substituted by the following:
A(a)
the defendant is ordered to pay to the plaintiff the sum of R 250 000 as
damages for the loss of support suffered by her in consequence of the
death of her husband Umar Sheik Amod in a motor car accident on 25
July 1993;
(b)
the defendant is to pay the costs of the action.@

2)
The respondent is ordered to pay the costs of the appellant in:

(a)
all proceedings to obtain leave to appeal against the said order of Meskin
J;
(b)
the proceedings on appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal.

Criminal appeal - alleged incest
JUDGMENT
MELUNSKY AJA

MELUNSKY AJA:
[1] Despite his plea of not guilty the appellant was convicted in the Umtata
regional court of committing incest with his daughter in contravention of s 99 of the
Transkeian Penal Code, 9 of 1983, during the period 1993 to 1996.  He was
sentenced to eight years imprisonment, two years of which were conditionally
suspended.  His appeal to the Supreme Court of Transkei (Miller and Madlanga JJ)
was unsuccessful but the court a quo granted him leave to appeal to this Court
against both conviction and sentence.
[2] The appellant is a schoolteacher.  At the relevant time he lived in Umtata.
His daughter, the complainant, was born on 16 June 1979.  She grew up under the
care of her maternal grandmother, Mrs Nancy Mlambo, in an area of Transkei
known as Sulenkama.  Towards the beginning of 1993 the complainant went to live
with the appellant in Umtata, where she attended school.  She stayed with him until

February 1996.
[3] The essence of the complainant's allegations against the appellant were that
a few months after she came to live with him, the appellant asked her to rub his
back, that he used to fondle her body, including her genitalia and that he later started
the practice of having sexual intercourse with her, an activity that occurred
regularly, perhaps three or four times a week.  In January 1994 she ascertained that
she was pregnant.  The appellant arranged for her to undergo an abortion which was
carried out at his home.  Thereafter the appellant continued to have sexual relations
with her until she eventually left him.  As I understand the complainant's evidence,
she was shocked and upset by the appellant's sexual demands.  Although she did not
resist, she was never a completely willing participant.
[4] According to the complainant's evidence, the appellant's attitude towards her
was one of possessiveness.  On the one hand he bought her expensive gifts and on
the other he resented her associations or liaisons with young men.  He assaulted her

from time to time, sometimes severely, particularly when, as she put it, she had a
boyfriend.  She recounted that on one occasion, after he had noticed an inscription
on her palm, he struck her with an iron bar on her head, resulting in an open wound.
The appellant threatened to commit suicide or to kill the complainant if she
disclosed his sexual activities with her.  Their relationship continued in this way
until she returned home on 6 February 1996 after she had been out with her
boyfriend.  The appellant did not approve.  He took her into the veld where he
assaulted her.  The complainant then left home and went to stay with her aunt, Ms
Monica Mlambo, in Soweto.
[5] The appellant denied that he had sexual intercourse or any other physical
relationship with the complainant.  He also denied any knowledge of the alleged
abortion.  He admitted that he used to ""clap her and (that he) used a cane to thrash
her"".  He called this ""moderate chastisement"" which, he indicated, he was entitled
to administer because the complainant made love to ""different and several men""

while she lived with him.
[6] The question for decision, of course, is whether on the evidence as a whole
the state has established the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  A
convenient starting point in this regard is a consideration of the trial court's reasons
for judgment.  The magistrate made no specific findings in relation to credibility or
demeanour, nor did he record that  he regarded the complainant as a satisfactory
witness or the appellant as unreliable.  The reasons which he furnished for
convicting the appellant, moreover, are not very convincing.  He held, in effect, that
the appellant had had ""every opportunity"" to commit incest with the complainant if
he had wanted to do so.  He also appeared to have been impressed with the
evidence of a social worker (Ms Mgilane) and a clinical psychologist (Ms
Mabusela) both of whom, in the magistrate's words, regarded the complainant as ""a
typical child who had been the subject of child abuse"".  In addition the magistrate
pointed out that the complainant had no reason to make false allegations against her

father, particularly allegations as serious as those which she had made.
[7] Counsel for the appellant invited us to hold that the complainant was an
untruthful and unreliable witness and that the appellant, on the contrary, gave
satisfactory evidence and, at least, that his version could reasonably possibly be
true.  It was also submitted on the appellant's behalf that the magistrate had
misdirected himself in various respects and that this Court should reassess the
evidence in the light of counsel's submissions.
[8] The attack on the complainant's credibility was not without justification.  Two
illustrations will suffice.  She initially stated in her evidence that although she had
had sexual intercourse with a person in Qumbu in  1992, the appellant was the only
person with whom she had sexual relations from 1993 until 1996.  It later emerged
from her own evidence that she had sexual intercourse with a young teacher on
several occasions during the period September 1995 to February 1996;  that she had
liaisons with other young men;  and that she had sexual intercourse ""with other men

because (she) wanted to console (herself)"".  She added that there was an age gap
between her and the appellant and she needed her peers who could understand her.
[9] It is important to emphasise that it is the appellant - and not the complainant -
who is on trial for his sexual activities and that the complainant's sexual
relationships are relevant for two reasons only:  firstly, because she was clearly
untruthful in this regard and secondly, because there is the possibility that her
pregnancy and the subsequent abortion might have followed on sexual intercourse
with someone other than the appellant.
[10] There are other unsatisfactory aspects of the complainant's evidence:  at some
stage while staying with the appellant she told a certain Mr Pongwana that she had
had sexual relations with his son, Andile.  Subsequently she told the father of
Pakamile Pongwana (who might have been Andile's brother) that she had had sexual
relations with Pakamile.  Furthermore the complainant alleged in March 1994 that
she had been raped by Pakamile during February 1993.  As a result she was

examined by a medical practitioner who, not surprisingly, found that there was no
indication of a sexual assault.  The alleged rape was also reported to the police.
She testified that she had falsely implicated the young men because her father, the
appellant, had put pressure on her to do so.  It is, however,  not at all clear what the
appellant stood to gain by compelling his daughter to make false allegations against
Andile or Pakamile and no evidence was led in this respect.  The appellant's
explanation, it may be added, was that shortly after the complainant's arrival in
Umtata, he found her in a compromising situation with Andile and after he had
questioned her, she admitted having had sexual relations with the young man.  He
then took her to Andile's parents to complain about their son's conduct.  The
appellant also admitted that he took the complainant to a doctor in 1994 after she
had claimed that she had been raped by Pakamile.  The allegation of rape was
reported to the police but no trial ensued as, to use the appellant's expression, ""the
matter was finalised by members of (Pakamile's) family"".  The appellant denied that

he had put any pressure on the complainant to induce her to implicate either Andile
or Pakamile.
[11] The appellant's counsel placed reliance on the evidence of Ms Babsy
Ndimande, a school teacher, who stayed with the appellant and the complainant
from some time in 1993 until February 1995.  Initially she shared a bed with the
complainant.  In June 1994 the appellant bought a bed for the complainant who then
moved to a separate room where she slept alone.  Ms Ndimande testified that the
appellant was a strict disciplinarian and that he hit the complainant, especially if she
was late in arriving home.  She had no knowledge of any sexual intimacy between
the appellant and the complainant but it is clear from her evidence that sexual
relations between them could have occurred before she came home from school or
while she was away during school holidays or over weekends.  She knew nothing
about the complainant's pregnancy or abortion.  After Ms Ndimande left the
appellant's home, an aunt of the complainant, Lindelwa, came to stay.  Lindelwa did

not give evidence and it is not clear for how long she lived in the appellant's house.
According to the complainant, however, the appellant continued to have sexual
relations with her after Lindelwa had moved in.
[12] This is a convenient stage to consider the evidence of the two expert
witnesses called by the State.  Ms Mgilane, a qualified and experienced social
worker, is no stranger to investigations relating to child abuse.  She is trained to
observe and assess complainants in child abuse cases.  Ms Mgilane pointed to
symptoms of sexual abuse in the case of the complainant, i.e. the complainant's
apparent lack of concentration, which resulted in a deterioration of her schoolwork,
and the nightmares from which she suffered.  She indicated that, in her view, the
complainant was manipulated by the appellant to such an extent that it was not
surprising that she kept his activities to herself for three years.  She pointed out that
the complainant's decision to run away from home was a common occurrence in the
case of victims of child abuse.

[13] Ms Mabusela holds a master's degree in clinical psychology.  She had worked
with cases of child abuse for a few years before she interviewed the complainant.
The complainant presented with a variety of complaints, all consistent with her
version of what had occurred between her and the appellant - tension headaches,
poor sleeping, poor appetite, poor concentration at school and forgetfulness.
[14] The other witnesses, both of whom were called by the State, were Mrs Nancy
Mlambo (the complainant's grandmother) and her daughter, Ms Monica Mlambo
(the complainant's aunt).  Mrs Mlambo, who was employed as a nurse in Qumbu,
told the trial court that she took the complainant to the appellant in 1993 at the
suggestion of the appellant's father so that the appellant could see to the further
education of the child.  The complainant's mother, who had not married the
appellant, lived some distance away at Tafalofefe and, as far as I can judge, did not
devote much time or attention  to her daughter.  The responsibility for bringing up
the child thus fell on Mrs Mlambo.  According to her, the complainant had been a

well-behaved girl while she lived with her.  Apparently Mrs Mlambo did not know
about the complainant's sexual experiences in 1992 as she testified that the
complainant gave her ""no problems concerning boys"".  She denied that it was the
complainant's misbehaviour that had resulted in her being placed in the appellant's
care and control at the beginning of 1993.  It may be observed that the appellant
gave evidence to the effect that the complainant had told him some two or three
years before 1993 that she wanted to attend school in Umtata and that she arrived
at his house in Umtata without any prior warning in January 1993.  She then
informed the appellant, he said, that she had been brought by her grandmother but
that she had come to stay with him in fulfilment of her own wish to be with him in
Umtata.  It is of some significance that the appellant's version of this occurrence was
not put to Mrs Mlambo or to the complainant.  What is more it was the appellant's
contention, as expressed by his attorney at the commencement of the trial and
repeated during the cross-examination of Mrs Mlambo, that it was the complainant's

misbehaviour that had led her grandmother to place her in the appellant's custody.
[15] The complainant's aunt, Ms Monica Mlambo, testified that the complainant
visited her during December 1995.  The complainant had a head injury and weals
on her buttocks and legs.  She told her aunt that the appellant had inflicted the
injuries.  She also experienced nightmares and complained of headaches.  The
appellant, it would seem, telephoned the complainant every day.  Ms Mlambo felt
that the relationship between father and daughter was very unusual and she raised
the question of sexual contact between the two of them.  The complainant did not,
at that stage, admit to a sexual relationship between her and the appellant.  It was
only on 9 February 1996, when she returned to Johannesburg after finally leaving
the appellant, that she told her aunt about the sexual relationship.  This resulted in
Ms Mlambo contacting her mother, Mrs Nancy Mlambo, who, too, went to
Johannesburg.  The complainant then repeated her story to her grandmother.
[16] The only other witness whose evidence was before the trial court was the

appellant.  His version, as I have mentioned, amounts to a complete denial of any
sexual contact with his daughter.  Save to the extent mentioned earlier, his  evidence
was not in itself unsatisfactory in the sense that it did not contain material
contradictions or inconsistencies.  Nor did he, on the face of it, appear to be evasive
or blatantly devious.
[17] Prior to the decision in S v Jackson 1998 (1) SACR 470 (SCA), it had long
been accepted that criminal cases of a sexual nature fell into a special category.  It
was said that there was an ""inherent danger"" in relying upon the unconfirmed
testimony of a complainant in a sexual case.  This resulted in  the courts adopting a
cautionary rule of practice.  The rule required -
a)
the recognition of the ""inherent danger"";  and
b)
the existence of some safeguard that reduced the risk of a wrong
conviction, such as corroboration of the complainant in a respect
implicating the accused, or the accused's failure to give evidence

or his obvious untruthfulness.
(See S v Snyman 1968 (2) SA 582 (A) at 585C-H.)
In S vJackson it was pointed out at 476e-f that the application of the cautionary rule
to sexual assault cases was based on irrational and out-dated perceptions.  Although
the evidence in a particular case might call for a cautionary approach, this, it was
emphasised in the judgment, was not a general rule:  the state was simply obliged to
prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  The factors which motivated this
Court to dispense with the cautionary rule  in sexual assault cases apply, in my view,
with equal force to all cases in which an act of a sexual nature is an element.  The
reasons given by Olivier JA at 474f-477d in S v Jackson therefore require no
elaboration or qualification in relation to the crime of incest and I proceed to
consider the evidence without the restraints imposed by the cautionary rule.
[18] This is a worrying and vexing case.  It is unlikely, but possible, that a daughter
would falsely admit to the commission of sexual acts with her father.  It is also

unlikely that she would lie about having had an abortion at the tender age of
fourteen.  Admissions of this nature would cast a grave slur on a child in the eyes of
her community as much as they would stigmatise the father.  Why, it may be asked,
would the complainant have implicated her father unless her version was true.
However, the fact that the complainant made serious allegations against her father
is obviously not decisive.  It is, in the circumstances of this case, only one of the
factors that have to be taken into account.
[19] On a proper consideration of the evidence one cannot fail to be impressed
with the comprehensive detail of the complainant's account.  Her portrayal of the
appellant as a possessive, domineering and jealous father has the distinct ring of
truth but in itself is insufficient to establish the appellant's guilt.  There is no doubt
that he inflicted severe beatings - which went far beyond the bounds of ""moderate
chastisement"" - on her.  The beatings do not redound to the appellant's credit and
lead me to doubt that he was a caring and loving father who was concerned only

with his daughter's well-being.
[20] The evidence of Ms Mgilane and, perhaps more significantly, that of Ms
Mabusela provide some support for the complainant's version.  Counsel did not
address any meaningful argument to this Court on the admissibility of the witnesses'
opinions to the effect that the complainant had been sexually abused.  However I will
assume, in favour of the state, that the conclusions drawn by the witnesses are
admissible in evidence.  It nevertheless remains the function of the Court to decide
upon the weight to be given to their views for we are not inexorably bound by what
witnesses have said or the opinions which they have expressed.  In weighing up their
evidence it may be accepted that the complainant's symptoms, including nightmares,
headaches and lack of concentration, were genuine and not simulated.  Significantly
enough similar symptoms had also been observed by the complainant's aunt in
December of the previous year.  I have no difficulty in accepting, therefore, that the
complainant was a traumatised young person.  The question is whether the

symptoms of which she complained were due to the appellant's sexual intimacy with
her.  It seems to be undisputed that the appellant was not a sympathetic father:  he
beat the complainant severely, he placed restrictions on her and he monitored her
movements closely.  Those factors alone might have played a role in her decision to
leave home.  And the fact that she left the appellant without his consent, coupled
with his harsh behaviour, might have resulted in the symptoms from which the
complainant suffered.  In my view the trial magistrate should have approached the
evidence of the social worker and the psychologist with more care and
circumspection than he did.  The complainant's symptoms were obviously consistent
with her allegations of sexual abuse, but other possible reasons for those symptoms
were not excluded by the evidence and this fact should have been recognised and
taken into account by the trial court.
[21] There is another unsatisfactory aspect of the magistrate's reasons.  He held
that the appellant arranged for his daughter to leave Mrs Ndimande's room for ""an

inexplicable reason"".  He concluded, therefore, that the appellant must have made
this arrangement so that he could have easier access to the complainant.  In fact Mrs
Ndimande and the complainant shared not only a room, but also a bed, for at least
a year.  It was in June 1994 that the appellant bought a bed for his daughter.  This
enabled her to move to her own room. The magistrate's finding that the appellant
bought a bed for the complainant so that he could have easier access to her is purely
speculative.  There was simply no evidence on this point.  It is possible that the
appellant was unable to afford to buy a bed earlier.  The fact is that the appellant
permitted his daughter and Mrs Ndimande to share a bed for over a year.
[22] Moreover, the magistrate failed to have due regard to Ms Ndimande's
presence in the house during 1993 and 1994.  The fact that she was staying in the
house does not mean that the appellant could not have had sexual intercourse with
the complainant while Ms Ndimande was out or away from Umtata.  She might have
been away when the complainant allegedly underwent an abortion.  Ms Ndimande

testified, however, that she would have known about a sexual relationship between
the appellant and his daughter.  She noticed nothing untoward in their relationship
and her only complaint about the appellant was that he was too strict a disciplinarian.
Neither the state nor the appellant called the complainant's aunt, Lindelwa, who also
stayed in the appellant's house.  From the complainant's evidence it would appear
that Lindelwa might have provided corroboration for her version.  There is no
suggestion that Lindelwa was not available to give evidence and no explanation has
been furnished for not calling her.
[23] It is to be regretted that the magistrate made no considered findings on the
quality of the witnesses, particularly on the credibility of the complainant and the
appellant.  In his reasons for the conviction, hardly a word was said about the
appellant's evidence.  Moreover, he did not appear to apply his mind properly, if at
all, to the highly unsatisfactory aspects of the complainant's evidence to which I have
referred.  The result is that this Court is called upon to reach a decision in a serious

criminal case without the assistance of detailed reasoning which is usually required
of a court of first instance.  In my view this Court is entitled, therefore, to consider
the evidence afresh.
[24] In March 1996, when the trial commenced in the regional court, the
complainant was sixteen years of age.  She appears to be a mature and intelligent
young person.  It has been established, however, that she was unreliable.  She lied
on an important aspect - by initially denying and later admitting that she had sexual
intercourse during 1993 to 1996 with men other than the appellant.  Moreover, on
her own admission, she falsely told a medical practitioner and the police that
Pakamile had raped her.  It is possible that shyness or modesty initially may have
prevented her from telling the truth about having had sexual relations during 1993
to 1996 but this is pure speculation as no evidence was led to explain her
contradiction.  It is also possible that the appellant did, as the complainant alleged,
persuade her to implicate Pakamile but, as I have earlier indicated, there was nothing

to show what the appellant stood to benefit from doing so.  The result is that the
complainant's untruthfulness casts a shadow on her evidence and on her credibility
as a witness.
[25] There is an additional matter which needs to be mentioned.  In December
1995 the appellant's aunt, Ms Monica Mlambo, suspected that the relationship
between the appellant and the complainant might have had a sexual aspect to it.
She then told the complainant about ""fathers who love their children to such an
extent that the father would make love to them"".  She added that ""the father would
say other fathers also do this to their children"".  At that time the complainant did not
admit to her aunt that there was a sexual relationship between her and the appellant.
When the complainant gave evidence at the trial some months later, she testified that
the appellant had said to her that she should not have a guilty conscience about
having sexual intercourse with him as this was a normal occurrence in other families
as well.  A consideration of this evidence gives rise  to a suspicion that the

complainant might have been influenced by her aunt to implicate the appellant.
[26] Although the appellant's evidence was also not free from blemish, his version
cannot be rejected out of hand in the absence of adverse credibility findings by the
trial court.  The beatings which he meted out to the complainant, severe as they
were, might indicate that he was not a caring father, but it cannot be inferred from
this, even coupled with the fact that he gave her gifts, that he also indulged in sexual
relations with her.
[27] Taking all of the facts into account, I am not satisfied that the state has proved
the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  The result may be unfortunate as the
complainant's version might be true and there is certainly considerable suspicion that
the appellant might be guilty of the offence with which he was charged.  The
appellant, however, is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.
[28] In the result the appeal succeeds and the conviction and sentence are set aside.

JUDGMENT

MPATI AJA

MPATI AJA :
[1] The question for determination in this appeal is whether an irregularity
occurred in the appellants' criminal trial by reason of an alleged failure by the
magistrate to inform and explain to them their legal rights and, if so, what effect
such irregularity had on the outcome of the trial.
[2] The three appellants were convicted in the magistrate's court at Cofimvaba,
in the erstwhile Transkei, of theft (a contravention of s 132 of the Transkei Penal
Code, Act 9 of 1983) and each sentenced to undergo a period of imprisonment of
four months.  Subsequent to their trial they instituted review proceedings in the
court a quo, inter alia, for an order setting aside the criminal proceedings on
grounds of certain alleged irregularities.   The court a quo declined to grant the
order sought for the setting aside of the criminal proceedings, but granted leave to
the appellants to appeal to this Court against such refusal.
[3] The alleged grounds of irregularity relied upon and as can be extracted from

the appellants' founding affidavit are the failure by the Magistrate to inform the
appellants of or to explain to them:
1.
their right to legal representation, including their entitlement to apply to the Legal
Aid Board, or other institutions, for legal assistance prior to the commencement
of the proceedings;
2.
their right to access to the contents of the police docket;
3.
their right to request further particulars to the charge;
4.
the nature and effect of pleading to the charge and the right to remain silent;
5.
the meaning of the offence with which they were charged;
6.
the purpose of cross-examination of witnesses during the trial and the
consequences of their failure to do so;
7.
their right to call witnesses;
8.
their right to address the court after close of the defence case.
[4] It was contended on behalf of the appellants that these omissions by the magistrate
constituted gross irregularities in the proceedings at common law;  alternatively that this Court,
in developing the common law in terms of the Constitution, should hold that the alleged failures

constitute gross irregularities.  In the further alternative it was contended that the alleged
irregularities constituted a direct violation of the  appellants' constitutionally guaranteed right to
a fair trial.   In each case the irregularities were such as to vitiate the proceedings, so it was
contended.
[5] Although a number of alleged grounds of irregularity have been raised, I propose to deal
first with what I consider to be the main complaint, as per counsel's submissions, viz. the
magistrate's alleged failure to inform the appellants of their right to legal representation and, if
necessary, to deal with the other grounds thereafter. The appellants alleged in their founding
affidavit that the magistrate failed to inform them of their right to apply for legal aid, or to be
supplied with legal representation at State expense where substantial injustice would otherwise
result.  The magistrate's response to these allegations was that the appellants' trial was fair ""as all
(their) rights were explained to them"".  She also stated that the appellants ""did not need a legal
representative as they said they have got no money"" and that they ""never indicated that they
needed a state attorney other than that they have got no money to pay for a lawyer"".  The latter
part was in response to the appellants' allegation that in view of the seriousness of the charge
preferred against them they should have been informed of their fundamental rights and should

have been afforded legal representation at State expense.  It seems clear to me from the
magistrate's responses that the appellants were indeed not informed of their basic rights.
[6] In my view, this matter can be disposed of on common law grounds.  In this respect a
clear distinction should be drawn between the right of an accused to be informed of his
entitlement to legal representation, more particularly the right to apply to the Legal Aid Board
for assistance, and to be afforded an opportunity to seek such representation, and the right to
obtain legal assistance at State expense.  The common law acknowledges the former and the
Constitution the latter.  Indeed, this distinction has received statutory recognition (see
amendment to section 3 of the Legal Aid Act 22 of 1969, introduced by section 1(a) of the Legal
Aid Amendment Act 20 of 1996).  What has been violated in the present case  is the first-
mentioned right.  In S v Rudman and Another;  S v Mthwana 1992 (1) SA 343 (A) Nicholas AJA,
having listed the rules formulated and implemented by our Courts and which have been evolved
for the assistance of undefended accused, said (at 382C-H):
""Another rule, not included in this list, was laid down in S v Radebe;  S v
Mbonani 1988 (1) SA 194 (T) by Goldstone, J, Van der Merwe J concurring.
The learned Judge referred at 194H-195D to a number of cases which he said 'are
but examples of a general duty on the part of judicial officers to ensure that
unrepresented accused fully understand their rights and the recognition that in the
absence of such understanding a fair and just trial may not take place'.  He said

(at 196F-I):
'If  there is a duty upon judicial officers to inform unrepresented
accused of their legal rights, then I can conceive of no reason why the right
to legal representation should not be one of them.  Especially where the
charge is a serious one which may merit a sentence which could be
materially prejudicial to the accused, such an accused should be informed
of the seriousness of the charge and of the possible consequences of a
conviction.  Again, depending upon the complexity of the charge, or of the
legal rules relating thereto, and the seriousness thereof, an accused should
not only be told of this right but he should be encouraged to exercise it.  He
should be given a reasonable time within which to do so.  He should also be
informed in appropriate cases that he is entitled to apply to the Legal Aid
Board for assistance.  A failure on the part of a judicial officer to do this,
having regard to the circumstances of a particular case, may result in an
unfair trial in which there may well be a complete failure of justice.  I
should make it  clear that I am not suggesting that the absence of legal
representation per se or the absence of the suggested advice to an accused
person per se will necessarily result in such an irregularity or an unfair trial
and the failure of justice.  Each case will depend upon its own facts and
peculiar circumstances.'
S v Radebe has been followed in most Provinces and, in the case of S
v Mabaso and Another 1990 (3) SA 185 (A) at 203D-G, Hoexter JA
expressed his entire agreement with the passage just quoted.""

[7] That an irregularity occurred in the present case is manifest, having regard to
the statement of the law by Nicholas AJA as quoted above.
[8] The crucial question to be answered is what legal effect such irregularity had

on the proceedings at the appellants' trial.  What needs to be stressed immediately
is that failure by a presiding judicial officer to inform an unrepresented accused of
his right to legal representation, if found to be an irregularity, does  not per se
result in an unfair trial necessitating the setting aside of the conviction on appeal.
(See S v Radebe 1988 (1) SA 194 (T) at 196I;  S v Mabaso and Another 1990 (3)
SA 185 (A) at 205D-E;  compare also S v Shikunga 1997 (2) SACR 470 (NmSC) at
483i).

[9] In the last-mentioned case, which was quoted with approval in S v Smile and
Another 1998 (1) SACR 688 (A) at 691f-i, it was said that the essential question to
be asked is whether the verdict has been tainted by such irregularity.  In S v
Rudman (at 391I) Nicholas AJA, having assumed that an irregularity had occurred
at the trial, held that it was for the appellant ""to show that a failure of justice
resulted from the irregularity"".  An irregularity could be said to result in a failure of
justice whenever there had been ""actual and substantial prejudice  to the accused"".

(See S v Ramalope 1995 (1) SACR 616 (A) at 621f-g and the cases there cited.)
Thus no failure of justice will result if there is no prejudice to an accused and, by
the same token, there will be no prejudice if the accused would in any event have
been convicted, irrespective of the irregularity.  (S v Davids;  S v Dladla 1989 (4)
SA 172 (N) at 193E.)  Transposing this test to the present matter, the question is
whether it can be said that the appellants would inevitably have been convicted had
the magistrate not committed the irregularity  (of omitting to inform them of their
basic rights).
[10] Nicholas AJA laid down in S v Rudman (at 391I), that the appellant (in that
case) could show that a failure of justice resulted (from the magistrate's failure to
inform the appellant of his right to apply for legal aid) by, for example, ""submitting
to the Court of appeal and to the magistrate for his comments an affidavit setting
out that he was unaware of his rights, and that if he had been informed of them he
would have tried to secure  representation, at least through the Legal Aid Board"".

In casu the appellants do not specifically state in their founding affidavit that had
they been informed of their right they would have exercised it by applying for legal
aid.  But it is apparent from other allegations made in the founding affidavit that
had they been so informed they probably would have exercised their right to apply
for legal aid.
[11] The appellants were charged with theft of green mealies and pumpkins with
an alleged estimated value of R7 320,00.  The version of the State was that the
appellants entered onto a field allegedly made available to the complainant by a
certain Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima and reaped the complainant's mealies and
pumpkins without his consent, thereby committing theft.   It appears from the
evidence that there was a dispute regarding ownership of the land on which the
mealies and pumpkins in issue were.  The evidence reveals that on the day of the
alleged theft the appellants and the complainant had attended a hearing at the
Regional Authorities Court, where the question of ownership of the said land,

which, according to the appellants, was owned by their late father, was to be
adjudicated upon.  It appears that the issue was not resolved on the day in question
and it was upon their return from the Regional Authorities Court that the appellants
were alleged to have committed the theft.
[12] In essence, then, the appellants have alleged that they were unable, in the
absence of legal representation, to establish their defence at the trial.  They claimed
that they were dispossessed of their land and alleged that ""(a)t the heart of the
matter is the lawfulness of our dispossession of land upon which the alleged
offence occurred and the lawfulness of the alleged title of that land of one
Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, who, in turn, leased it to the complainant ..."".  As I
have already mentioned, on the day in question the appellants had gone to the
Regional Authorities Court for resolution of the question of ownership of the land
on which the alleged theft occurred.   That at the trial the appellants claimed a right
to the land is borne out by  the fact that in his testimony the first appellant said the

following:
""I entered my own field and reaped"",
and:
""I had a right to reap the mealies any time I wanted.""
The following also appears from the record:
""Q
After that resolution (at the Regional Authorities Court) you
decided to go to the mealie field of the complainant.
A
Correct, but according to my rights.""
[13] From the aforegoing it seems to me that the appellants were raising a
defence, though not eloquently articulated,  that they were  entitled to reap from the
land, as it was theirs, alternatively that they were bona fide of the view that they
were acting lawfully and thus not with the intention to steal.  In my view, a legal
representative would have properly formulated the appellants' defence and would
have cross-examined the state witnesses in accordance with such a defence.  A

reading of the record reveals that although the appellants cross-examined the
witnesses called by the state, such cross-examination was not at all pointed in any
direction.  This is not surprising as the first appellant is only semi-literate, having
progressed to standard 5 at school, while the second and third appellants are
completely illiterate.   They never put their defence to the witnesses and were never
advised to do so by the magistrate, who was  required to assist them in formulating
their questions, clarifying the issues and properly putting their defence to the state
witnesses.  (S v Rudman; S v Johnson;  S v Xaso;  Xaso v Van Wyk NO 1989 (3) SA
368 (E) at 378D-E and the cases there cited.)  Not surprisingly, their failure to put
their defence to witnesses counted against the appellants in the end.  The magistrate
says in her reasons for judgment:
""In their cross-examination they concerned themselves with things
that were not important, not directing their questions on the offence
charged.  Hence they were asked as to why didn't they deny or
challenge the evidence led in their response they said they have
forgotten or made a mistake.""

This statement underlines the fatal effect of the irregularity committed by the
magistrate.
[14] The court a quo placed strong reliance on the absence of ""administrative
machinery rendering free legal services"" in the former Transkei and held that the
magistrate's failure to inform the appellants of their right to ""free legal services""
bore no significance in that the appellants ""would not have received such services
because they did not exist in the former Transkei"".
[15] To my mind this is an irrelevant consideration.  South Africa became a
unitary State on 27 April 1994 and as from that date  full South African citizenship
was conferred also upon those who were, until then, citizens of so-called
independent or self-governing states.   The reasoning that the appellants would in
any event not have received ""free legal services"" because of the absence of
administrative machinery for that purpose is untenable and cannot be proffered as

an excuse to deny a section of the South African society, merely because they
happen to be in a particular area, of rights otherwise enjoyed by the rest of the
country.  Further, there is no evidence that, if approached, the Legal Aid Board
would not have appointed a legal representative for the appellants.
[16] In view of the conclusion I have reached regarding the fatal nature of the
irregularity committed by the magistrate, a consideration of the other irregularities
raised by the appellants becomes unnecessary.  It also becomes unnecessary to
consider counsel's arguments based on the Constitution.
[17] The appeal succeeds.  Paragraph 2 of the order of the court a quo is set aside
and in its stead is substituted the following:
""The applicants' convictions and sentences are set aside"".

J U D G M E N T

FARLAM AJA:
[1] This is an appeal, by leave of this court, against a decision by Nugent J given
in the Witwatersrand Local Division, whereby he ordered summary judgment
against first and second appellants (defendants in the court below) in the sum of
R500 000, together with interest and costs, and declared Erf 898, Parkwood
Township, Registration Division 1 R Transvaal, which is registered in the name of
first appellant, to be specially executable.  The order was granted at the instance of
the respondent bank (plaintiff in the court below).  For convenience I shall continue
to refer to the parties as plaintiff and first and second defendants.

[2] One of Plaintiff’s claims against first defendant, a close corporation of which
second defendant is the sole member, was based on a deed of suretyship signed by
second defendant on its behalf on 13 January 1995, in which it bound itself as surety
and co-principal debtor with one Michael Gaganakis, who is second defendant’s
husband and whose estate was provisionally sequestrated on 16 January 1996 and
finally sequestrated on 20 February 1996.  The deed of suretyship provided, inter
alia,  that the first defendant bound itself as surety and co-principal debtor with the
second defendant’s  husband for payment by him to the plaintiff of all obligations
owed, owing,   or to be owed by him to  the plaintiff  arising from any cause of
indebtedness whatsoever, but that the amount recoverable thereunder from first
defendant would not exceed R500 000, plus interest and costs.
[3] Plaintiff also  relied as against first defendant on a covering mortgage bond
registered on 11 January 1995, i.e., two days before the deed of suretyship referred
to above was executed, in terms of which  first defendant hypothecated in favour of

the plaintiff the erf already referred to as a continuing covering security for any
indebtedness owing by it to the plaintiff.
[4] The plaintiff’s claim against second defendant was based on a deed of
suretyship signed by second defendant on 29 September 1994 in which she bound
herself as surety and co-principal debtor with her husband.  This deed of suretyship
also provided  that second defendant’s liability thereunder would extend to all
obligations of her husband arising from any cause of indebtedness whatsoever but
would be limited to R500 000 together with interest and costs.
[5] Plaintiff alleged in its particulars of claim that the second defendant’s husband
was indebted to it in an amount of R237 772-28, with interest thereon at the rate of
20.5% per annum from 1 June 1996, in terms of an acknowledgment of debt he had
signed in its favour on 15 November 1991 and that he was indebted to it in a further
amount of R1 363 021-81, with interest at the rate of 20.5% per annum from 1 June
1996, being the overdrawn balance as at 31 May 1996 on the banking account he

had operated at the plaintiff’s Johannesburg branch from about March 1984.
[6] Affidavits deposed to by second defendant resisting  summary judgment were
filed on behalf of both defendants.   Annexed to second defendant’s affidavits were
affidavits by her husband confirming as true and correct the contents of his wife’s
affidavits in so far as they related to him.
[7] In her affidavits second defendant said that both of the deeds of suretyship
and the mortgage bond sued on by plaintiff had to be rectified so as to reflect the
common continuing intention of the parties.  She ascribed the failure of the
documents in question to reflect the common continuing intention of the parties to
the fact that standard form documents were used which were not adapted to record
correctly what had been orally agreed before they were completed.
[8] So far as the deeds of suretyship were concerned second defendant said that
it had been orally agreed between the plaintiff’s representative and herself, as
represented by her husband, that the two deeds of suretyship would only come into

operation if the principal debtor, i.e. her husband, were to become liable to plaintiff
in respect of a guarantee for R500 000 which plaintiff undertook to issue on her
husband’s behalf to a company known as Rothsay Property Holdings (Pty) Ltd or
its nominee, as part of an effort to settle a dispute regarding fees allegedly owed to
her husband by some of his clients, the principal one of which was Rothsay Property
Holdings (Pty) Ltd.  Second defendant also stated that plaintiff never issued the
guarantee referred to, with the result that the liability in respect of which the deeds
of suretyship were to operate never came into existence.
[9] As far as the covering mortgage bond was concerned second defendant stated
that it had been orally agreed between plaintiff’s representative and first defendant,
as represented by her husband, that first defendant’s liability under the mortgage
bond was to be limited to securing the balance outstanding from time to time on an
amount of R720 000 advanced by plaintiff  to second defendant in respect of what
was described as a home loan, which enabled her  to purchase the member’s interest

in first defendant, the registered owner of  the erf over which the bond was passed
and on which was erected the home occupied by second defendant and her husband.
[10] In his judgment in the court below Nugent J held that the facts alleged by the
defendants did not entitle them to rectification of the deeds of suretyship or to
rectification of the mortgage bond and that in the circumstances the defendants had
not disclosed any defence to the claims of the plaintiff, which was accordingly
entitled to summary judgment.
[11] The learned judge said:
“The prior oral agreements sought to be relied upon are self-evidently
in conflict with the written memorial of the various transactions.  That seems
to me to be classically the situation in which proof of the prior oral
agreements is precluded by the parol evidence rule. . . .
It [i.e., the remedy of rectification] has no application where the
document correctly reflects the words which the parties intended to record,
but the words so used do not correctly reflect the parties’ prior agreement or
common intention.  The parol evidence rule precludes proof of such prior
agreement or common intention if its effect would be to vary or alter the

memorial of the transaction. . . .
There is no suggestion by the deponent in the present case that she was
under any misapprehension as to what was recorded in each of the documents
at the time she signed them.  There is no suggestion either that she expected
the documents to contain words, having the effect now contended for, or that
she expected a covering letter of any kind to be placed on the document
having that effect.  The alleged mistake, in her own words, was merely in
believing that the prior oral agreements would prevail over the writing which
was in conflict therewith.”
[12] In support of this conclusion he relied on the decisions in Von Ziegler and
Another v Superior Furniture Manufacturers (Pty) Ltd 1962 (3)  SA 399 (T),
Neuhoff v York Timbers Ltd 1981 (4) SA 666 (T) and in Rand Bank Ltd v
Rubenstein 1981 (2) SA 207 (W), which were all, in his view, indistinguishable in
principle from this case.
He also held that the decision of this court in Mouton v Hanekom 1959 (3)
SA 35 (A), on which the defendant’s counsel strongly relied, was distinguishable
because, so he said, there was no suggestion that the defendants were misled by the
plaintiff in the present case.

[13] Counsel for the defendants contended that the learned judge erred in holding
that rectification  was precluded by the parol evidence rule.  In this regard he
submitted that the learned judge fell into error because the parol evidence rule does
not exclude evidence of a prior oral agreement or a common continuing intention
which a party seeks to lead in support of a claim for rectification: see Rand
Rietfontein Estates Ltd v Cohn 1937 AD 317 at 327, to quote but one of the many
authorities on the point.
[14] In my opinion this criticism is clearly justified.
[15] The learned judge’s view that for a claim for rectification to be competent the
mistake relied on must relate to the writing in the document and that a court cannot
have regard to any other kind of mistake is not supported by  authority nor is there
any reason based on principle that can be relied on in support of it:  see, e.g., Offit
Enterprises (Pty) Ltd & Others v Knysna Development Co (Pty) Ltd & Others 1987
(4) SA 24 (C) at 27 D-E

[16] To allow the words the parties actually used in the documents to override
their prior agreement or the common intention that they intended to record is to
enforce what was not agreed, and so overthrow the basis on which contracts rest in
our law: the application of no contractual  theory  leads to such a result.
[17] I am also of the view that Mouton v Hanekom, supra, is not distinguishable
in this matter and that the ratio thereof is directly contrary to the conclusion to
which Nugent J came.
In Mouton v Hanekom, supra, the parties entered into a written contract of
sale and an oral pactum de retrovendendo which they agreed would not be
incorporated into their written contract.  Despite the fact that  the terms of the oral
agreement were intentionally omitted from the written contract rectification was
allowed .  This court assumed that parol evidence of the oral pactum would
contradict the written contract but held that it was admissible to rectify the latter
because of the parties’ mistake, not  as to what was recorded, but as to its effect,

which was to  prevent their oral agreement from operating with their written
contract: see at 39 H- 40 A and the comment  by Trollip J in Von Ziegler’s case at
411 A - D.
[18] In the present matter also the signatories were not mistaken as to what was
contained in the documents signed by second defendant.  The mistake which she
says she and the plaintiff made was in thinking that despite  the contents of those
documents, the preceding oral agreements would still be operative.  This mistake
was clearly capable of rectification on the strength of the principle affirmed in
Mouton v Hanekom.
[19] Counsel for the plaintiff contended  in this court that, even if Nugent J’s
approach was wrong in law, as I have found it was, the order he made was correct
because the second defendant’s affidavits did not establish that she and the first
defendant had bona fide defences to the plaintiff’s claims.  They referred to various
respects in which the allegations made by the second defendant were said to be

vague,  unclear and confusing.
[20] It is correct that no particularity was furnished as to the arrangement under
which her husband had to provide a guarantee for R500 000 to his clients as part of
an effort to settle a dispute regarding fees allegedly owed by his clients to him. It
was not at all clear how such a dispute could be resolved on the basis that he owed
money to his clients so that they wanted a guarantee which they could “cash”, as the
second defendant put it, if the dispute was resolved in their favour.
[21] Counsel for the plaintiff also pointed out that in her second affidavit the
second defendant referred to her alleged belief and the mistake she made.  This, it
was said, was  indicative rather of unilateral error on her part  than of  common error
by both parties.
[22] In my view these contentions cannot be upheld.  It has to be remembered that
the relief sought by the plaintiff in this matter is summary judgment.  In Maharaj v
Barclays National Bank Ltd 1976 (1) SA 418 (A) at 423 F - G, Corbett JA referred

to the “extraordinary and drastic nature” of the remedy of summary judgment and
said that  “the grant of the remedy is based upon the supposition that the plaintiff’s
case is unimpeachable and that the defendant’s defence is bogus or bad in law.”
Later (at 426 A - 426 E) Corbett JA said the following:
“[O]ne of the ways in which a defendant may successfully oppose a
claim for summary judgment is by satisfying the Court by affidavit  that he
has a bona fide defence to the claim.  Where the defence is based upon facts,
in the sense that material facts alleged by the plaintiff in his summons, or
combined summons, are disputed or new facts are alleged constituting a
defence, the Court does not attempt to decide these issues or to determine
whether or not there is a balance of probabilities in favour of the one party or
the other.  All that the Court enquires into is: (a) whether the defendant has
‘fully’ disclosed the nature and grounds of his defence and the material facts
upon which it is founded, and (b) whether on the facts so disclosed the
defendant appears to have, as to either the whole or part of the claim, a
defence which is both bona fide and good in law.  If satisfied on these
matters the Court must refuse summary judgment, either wholly or in part, as
the case may be.  The word ‘fully’, as used in the context of the Rule (and its
predecessors), has been the cause of some judicial controversy in the past.
It connotes, in my view, that, while the defendant need not deal exhaustively
with the facts and the evidence relied upon to substantiate them, he must at
least disclose his defence and the material facts upon which it is based with
sufficient particularity and completeness to enable the Court to decide

whether the affidavit discloses a bona fide defence. (See generally, Herb
Dyers (Pty.) Ltd. v Mohamed and Another, 1965 (1) SA 31 (T); Caltex Oil
(SA) Ltd v Webb and Another, 1965 (2) SA 914 (N), Arend and Another v
Astra Furnishers (Pty) Ltd, [1974 (1) SA 298 (C)] at pp. 303-4; Shepstone
v Shepstone, 1974 (2) SA 462 (N)). At the same time the defendant is not
expected to formulate his opposition to the claim with the precision that
would be required of a plea; nor does the Court examine it by the standards
of pleading.  (See Estate Potgieter v Elliot, 1948 (1) SA 1084 (C) at p. 1087;
Herb Dyers case, supra at p. 32.)”
(See also Breitenbach v Fiat SA (Edms) Bpk 1976 (2) SA 226 (T) at 227 G
to  228 F.)
[23] Describing the defendant’s affidavit as not “a wholly satisfactory document”
the learned judge of appeal said that it did, nevertheless,  “appear to disclose a
defence which seems, on the face of it, to be bona fide” and concluded  (at 428 C)
as follows:
“Viewing the affidavit as a whole, in the context of the claim set forth
in plaintiff’s summons, I am of the view that it does appear to raise a bona
fide defence and that it has disclosed this defence and the material facts upon
which it is founded with just - and only just - sufficient particularity and
completeness in order to comply with Rule 32 (3) (b).”

[24] The second defendant has said that the deeds of suretyship she signed in
favour of the plaintiff in her personal capacity and on behalf of first defendant were
only intended to be in respect of her husband’s conditional liability to the plaintiff
under the guarantee the plaintiff was to issue to Rothsay Property Holdings (Pty) Ltd
or its nominee.  The plaintiff never issued the guarantee and so her husband never
became liable in respect of payments made thereunder.  Initially she only signed a
deed of suretyship in her personal capacity, which was “backed”, as it were, by a
bond limited to an amount of R500 000, passed over the property she then owned
at  Forest Town.  When her Forest Town property was sold and she acquired the
member’s interest in first defendant, which owned the Parkwood property, she was
persuaded, in view of the fact that the bond over the Forest Town property was to
be cancelled, to replace it by a deed of suretyship given on behalf of first defendant.
Both deeds of suretyship were given only in respect of her husband’s conditional
liability.  Some credence is lent to this version by the fact that her husband was

already indebted to the plaintiff under the acknowledgement of debt signed by him
in November 1991 and had been operating a current bank account with the plaintiff
since 1984.  We do not know what the balance on his overdraft was when the deeds
of suretyship were signed but we are told that his estate was provisionally
sequestrated on 16 January 1996 and that as at 31 May 1996 his overdrawn bank
balance stood at R1 363 021-81.  In the circumstances it is not unlikely that when
the deeds of suretyship were signed the total amount he owed to the plaintiff  was
substantially in excess of R500 000, which is the limit in both deeds of suretyship
and is the principal sum referred to in the bond over  the Forest Town property in
respect of which a power of attorney to pass a bond was signed on the same day as
the deed of suretyship signed by the second defendant in her personal capacity. If
a guarantee for
R500 000 was to be issued by the plaintiff in favour of Rothsay Property Holdings
(Pty) Ltd or its nominee at that time then the clauses limiting the liability of the first

and second defendants in their deeds of suretyship to that amount would tend to
support the second defendant’s allegations in this regard.  As far as the bond passed
over the Parkwood property is concerned, the principal sum stated in the bond, viz.
R750 000-00, which is the amount referred to as the amount of the bond to be
passed over the property in the home loan letter sent by the plaintiff to the second
defendant in January 1995,  supports the second defendant’s allegation that the bond
sued on by the plaintiff is what can be described as the home loan bond.  The home
loan letter sent by the plaintiff to the second defendant also refers to the proceeds
of the sale of the Forest Town property, which confirms the second defendant’s
allegations that that property had been sold and replaced, as it were, by the property
owned by the first defendant of which the second defendant had become the sole
member.
[25] The allegations relating to the common continuing intention of the parties and
the error made by the plaintiff and herself are in my view just enough to comply with

the requirements of Rule 32 (3) with regard to the nature and grounds of the defence
raised.  The difficulty remains relating to the lack of particularity regarding all
material facts relied upon, more especially the arrangement under which the plaintiff
was to issue a guarantee on behalf of second defendant’s husband.   In this respect
the affidavits fall short of what is required by Rule 32 (3) to enable the court to
assess the defendant’s bona fides.
[26] That is not the end of the matter because, as was pointed out in Maharaj’s
case at 425 H (see also Arend and Another v Astra FurnishersPty Ltd 1974 (1) SA
298 (C)  at 304 F - 305 H), the court still has a discretion in such a case to refuse
summary judgment. In Arend’s case and the cases quoted in it, it is stated that the
discretion may be exercised in a defendant’s favour if there is doubt as to whether
the plaintiff’s case is unanswerable and there is a reasonable possibility that the
defendant’s defence is a good one.  I have already given reasons for holding that the
defence raised in this matter is not bad in law.  There is, in addition,  sufficient

evidentiary  material in the second defendant’s affidavits to lead me to believe that
the plaintiff’s case may not be unanswerable and in the circumstances  I am satisfied
that  this is one of those exceptional  cases in which  the exercise of the court’s
discretion to refuse summary judgment is appropriate.
[27] It follows in my view that the defendants should have been given leave to
defend.
[28] When the appeal was argued counsel for the defendants asked for an order
condoning their failure to file the record timeously.  It appears from an affidavit
deposed to by their Bloemfontein attorney that the reason that the record was filed
late was that portions of the original record, which was filed in time, had to be
retyped to comply with requirements imposed by the registrar of this court,  relating
in the main to the format of certain pages.   The plaintiff’s attorneys, when requested
by defendant’s attorneys for an extension of time for  filing  the record, refused to
agree.  In my view the request for an extension in this case was reasonable and the

refusal was unreasonable and the plaintiff should pay the costs occasioned thereby.
[29] The record as filed contains the application to this Court for leave to appeal,
which clearly should not have been included.  The costs occasioned by the inclusion
of this part of the record should accordingly be disallowed.
[30] The following order is made:
1.
Appellant’s failure to file the record of appeal timeously is condoned.
2.
Respondent is ordered to pay the costs of the application for
condonation of the late filing of the appeal record.
3.
The appeal is allowed with costs.
4.
The costs of including the application for leave to appeal in the appeal
record are disallowed.
5.
The order of the trial court is set aside and there is substituted an
order in the following terms:
“Summary judgment is refused and defendants are granted leave to

defend the action.  The costs of the application for summary judgment
are left over for decision by the trial court.”

MINERAL LEASE - WHETHER OPTION DULY EXERCISED
JUDGMENT
ZULMAN JA:

[1]   The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant entered into a valid and
enforceable notarial mineral lease with the trustee of the Bafokeng Tribe.
[2]   In December 1993 the President of the Republic of Bophuthatswana, in his
capacity as trustee of the Bafokeng Tribe, as the first applicant, and the Tribe, as the
second applicant, commenced motion proceedings against the appellant as first
respondent in the Supreme Court of Bophuthatswana.  The Regional Director:
Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs and the Registrar of Deeds were  cited
as the second and third respondents respectively but they did not oppose the
application.   They also take no part in this appeal and abide by the decision of this
Court.  After re-incorporation of Bophuthatswana into the Republic of South Africa
the Premier of North West Province attempted to substitute himself as the first
applicant but his substitution was declared to be invalid.  The true successor to the
first applicant, the President of the Republic of South Africa, designated the
Minister of Land Affairs as the Tribe's trustee.  The Tribe withdrew as a party to the
proceedings and the Minister, in his capacity as trustee, became the sole applicant.
He is now the first respondent in this appeal.
[3] The notice of motion as finally amended claimed declaratory orders to the
effect that there was no exercise, alternatively no valid or effectual exercise by the
appellant of an option to acquire a mineral lease under and in terms of a notarial
prospecting agreement which contained the option;  alternatively, if there was a

valid and effectual exercise of the option, the appellant thereafter abandoned the
resultant mineral lease;  and, further alternatively, that the option contained in the
notarial prospecting agreement lapsed without  having been exercised.
[4] Waddington J dismissed the application with costs but granted the first
respondent leave to appeal to the Full Court of the Bophuthatswana Division of the
High Court.
[5] The Full Court  (Khumalo, Hendler and Chulu JJ) allowed the appeal with
costs and declared that no mineral lease arose under or in terms of the agreement
relied upon by the appellant.
[6]     On 18 August 1997 this court granted special leave to the appellant to appeal
against the judgment of the court a quo and ordered the costs  of the application to
be costs in the appeal.
[7] The material facts of the case are not in dispute.  On 28 July 1977 a notarially
executed agreement was entered into between the deputy Minister of Bantu Affairs,
acting for and on behalf of the Minister of Bantu Administration, Development and
Education in his capacity ""as Trustee of the Bafokeng Tribe under Chief Edward
Molotlegi"" as lessor and Palmiet Chrome Corporation (Pty) Limited (""Palmiet"") as
lessee.  On 25 October 1978, in terms of a notarially executed document, Palmiet
ceded, assigned and made over all its right, title and interest in the aforesaid
agreement to the appellant.  The amendment to the agreement was notarially

executed on 11 July 1979.
[8] The agreement as amended is of fundamental importance in this appeal.  it is
divided into two parts.  The first part contains a prospecting agreement and the
second an option to acquire a mineral lease.  In order to determine whether a valid
and enforceable mineral lease came into being, it is necessary to decide whether the
option was effectively exercised.  In terms of the prospecting part of the agreement
the lessor granted the lessee the sole and exclusive right to prospect for chrome ore
for a period of up to five years on portions of certain land owned by the lessor.  The
relevant part of clause 3,  which contains the option for the mineral lease, reads as
follows:
""During the Prospecting Period the Lessee shall have the sole and
exclusive option of mining and disposing of Chrome Ore in, on or
under the Mining Area.  The Lessee at its sole discretion, may exercise
these rights by giving written notice to this effect to the Lessor, the
Magistrate Bafokeng and the Bantu Mining Corporation Limited,
Pretoria, and shall state a date within the Prospecting Period upon
which such operations will commence.""
It was common cause between the parties that The Bantu Mining Corporation
Limited ceased to exercise functions in the then Bophuthatswana after it became
independent and that notice to him was thereafter not required in terms of clause 3.
[9] Clause 1(a) of the agreement defines the ""Prospecting Period"" as being a
period of up to 5 (five) years from the date of the agreement, i.e. 28 July 1977.  The
""Mining Area"" is the area in which the lessee had the right to prospect.

[10] The outcome of this appeal depends upon whether the requirements of clause
3 and the provisions of section 3(1) of the General Law Amendment Act 50 of 1956
(""the Act"") were complied with.  The section provides that a lease of any right to
minerals in land shall not be valid unless attested by a notary public.  In my view,
in order to succeed, therefore, the appellant had to establish -
(a)
that the option was exercised in notarial form during the
""prospecting period"", i.e. on or before 27 July 1982;
(b)
that written notice of the exercise was given to the following
persons:
(i)
the lessor as defined, namely, the trustee of the Bafokeng Tribe;
and
(ii)
the Magistrate Bafokeng;
(c)
that the appellant duly ""[stated] a date within the prospecting
period upon which such operations"" [the mining and disposing
of chrome ore] ""will commence"".
[11] If any one of the above requirements were not fulfilled, it would follow that
there was no effective exercise of the option.
Timeous exercise in notarial form and statement of commencement date.
[12]    It is convenient to consider these two aspects of clause 3 together.  Counsel
for the appellant submitted that the exercise of the option in notarial form occurred

on 7 July 1982.   On this date a document headed ""Notarial Exercise of Option to
Take a Mineral Lease"" (""Annexure I"") was notarially executed.  On behalf of  the
first respondent it was contended that the notarial execution relied upon by the
appellant, even though it occurred timeously, was defective in a number of material
respects.
[13]    One of these defects, so it was argued, was that in the operative portion of
Annexure I, as distinct from the preamble thereto, the appellant purported to
exercise the right to mine manganese ore and not chrome ore.  This, according to the
argument, introduced uncertainty and rendered the notarial document ineffective (cf
Boerne v Harris 1949 (1) SA 793 (A) at 799).  Although a substituted page of the
notarial document which referred to chrome ore instead of manganese ore was
forwarded to the Tribe's attorney, this occurred on 18 August 1982 and after the
date for the exercise of the option had expired.  The respondent's contention was
rejected by Waddington J in the court of first instance but was upheld by the court
a quo.  It would appear to me, however, that the recipient of Annexure I should have
realised that the appellant had intended to exercise the option to mine for chrome ore
and that the reference to manganese ore was an obvious error.  However in view of
the conclusion at  which I have arrived  in regard to the non-compliance with certain
of the other requirements of clause 3 it is not necessary to express a firm view on
the first respondent's contentions concerning this aspect of the matter.

[14]    A further objection advanced by the first respondent was that Annexure I did
not specify a date on which mining would commence.  The document merely
recorded that the appellant exercised the option contained in the agreement and that
it accepted a lease to mine ""for manganese ore in, on and under the Mining Area"".
It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that although clause 3 of the agreement
required the lessee  to state a date within the prospecting period upon which mining
operations would commence, the agreement drew a distinction between the date of
commencement of the mineral lease and the date of commencement of the mining
operations.  The former, it was submitted, was a material term and required notarial
execution but the latter not.  Reliance was placed on a letter dated 7 May 1982
addressed to the Tribe's attorney and signed by a Mr S M Dougherty on behalf of
the appellant in which it was stated:
""In terms of the rights granted to the Lessee under clause 3, we hereby
exercise the whole and exclusive option thereby granted the Lessee to
mine and dispose of chrome ore in, on or under the mining area (as
defined).  It is our intention to commence such mining operations on
15 July 1982.""
(An earlier letter sent to the Tribe's attorney in identical terms and signed by Mr
Dougherty on behalf of Rand Mines Ltd, was not relied upon.)
On a proper construction of the provisions of the  mineral lease it is, however, plain
that the date of commencement of the mineral lease was to coincide with the stated

date on which mining operations were to commence.  Clause 3(h) being one of the
provisions that was to apply to the mineral lease, reads:
""The Mineral Lease shall endure for an initial period of 15 (fifteen)
years from the date advised in the written notices referred to in the first
paragraph of this Clause 3, with two further periods of renewal of 10
(ten) years each if required by the lessee.""
The date of the commencement of mining operations was, therefore, also the date
on which the mineral lease was to commence.  This date was a material term of the
lease  (cf Johnston v Leal 1980(3) SA 927(A) at 937B - 938B).    It determined,
inter alia, when the prospecting rights and duties would cease and when the mining
rights and obligations would commence, when the lease would begin and when it
would terminate and when the lessee's obligation to pay mining royalties would
start.  Counsel for the appellant conceded, quite correctly, that if the date of
commencement of mining was material it had to be recorded in a notarially executed
document and that the letter of 7 May 1982 would not suffice in this regard.
[15]    In the court of first instance Waddington J held that in the absence of any
other stated date in Annexure I, it was the date of execution of that document, 7 July
1982, that the appellant
""must have intended should be regarded as the date on which mining
operations would commence"".

I am unable to agree with this conclusion.  There is nothing to indicate that the
appellant intended to regard 7 July 1982 as the date on which it would commence
mining operations.  Moreover, even if this was the appellant's intention, it was not
expressed in the document and was not conveyed to the parties referred to in clause
3 of the contract.
[16]   The provisions of the clause, if one reads the clause in its ordinary
grammatical sense, fall to be construed conjunctively and not disjunctively.   The
requirements are imperative, since clause 3 specifies “and shall state a date” (the
emphasis is mine).   The wording is not simply “may” state a date.
[17]    I also agree with the first respondent’s contention that the scheme of clause
3 was that the exercise of the option to bring about a mineral lease did not in itself
lead to commencement of the mineral lease.  The appellant was required  to state a
date.  This would determine two matters.  The first would be the date when mining
operations “will commence” and secondly as a consequence thereof, the date when
the prospecting agreement referred to in the document would cease and a mineral
lease would become operative in terms of the second paragraph of clause 3.  This
paragraph provides as follows:-
“In the event of these mining rights being exercised the liability for
paying prospecting rentals as provided under Clause 1 hereof and the
prospecting rights granted under Clause 2 hereof shall cease as from
the date that the mining right shall commence.  The following terms
and conditions shall then apply as from the date:-”

(A number of terms and conditions  then follow in clauses 3(a) to 3(h)).
There were thus two relevant dates.  The one being the date on which the notice
itself had to be given and the other the date when the mining operations “will”
commence.  The notice had to be given by 27 July and the date upon which mining
operations were to commence had to be on or before the same date.
[18]    It was also argued on behalf of the appellant that Annexure I, which was in
notarial form and was executed in that form on 7 July 1982, “declared on that date”
to exercise the option contained in clause 3 to take “thereby” a lease.  The taking
of the lease, so it was argued, is intended to take effect from the declaration therein
that the appearer states himself “thereby” to take.   That being so the duration of the
lease extended from that date, namely 7 July 1982.  I find this argument untenable.
There might have been some merit in the  argument were it not for the clear and
unambiguous requirement of clause 3 that there was to be a statement which was to
be communicated to “the lessor, the Magistrate Bafokeng and the Bantu Mining
Corporation Ltd” of the date in the written notice exercising the option “in the
Prospecting Period upon which such operations will commence”. This provision
cannot simply be ignored.
As the appellant failed to state in a notarially executed document the date on which
mining operations would commence, it follows that the exercise of the option is of
no force and effect and that no mineral lease came into existence.  There are,

moreover, other obstacles in the appellant's path.  These are considered briefly
hereunder.
The giving of notice
[19]    It is trite that ordinarily and in the absence of any contractual provision to the
contrary, the fact of the exercise of an option which involves the acceptance of an
offer, must, to bring about a binding contract, be communicated to the grantor.  The
exercise of an option is governed by the ordinary principles applicable to the
acceptance of an offer.  (See for example R v Nel 1921 AD 339, Laws v Rutherfurd
1924 AD 261 at 262, and Westinghouse Brake and Equipment (Pty) Ltd v Bilger
Engineering (Pty) Ltd 1986(2) SA 555(A) at 573 E - G and Amcol Collieries
Limited v Truter 1990(1) SA 1 (A) at 4 D-F).  Not only did clause 3 of the
agreement not dispense with communication but it required it in clear and
unequivocal terms.  This is not a case such as Driftwood Properties (Pty) Ltd v
McLean 1971(3) SA 591(A)  where the agreement dispensed with communication
of acceptance. In this case the appellant, as was the situation in Orion Investments
(Pvt) Ltd v Ujamaa Investments (Pvt) Ltd and Others 1988(1) SA 583 (ZS), was
required in terms of clause 3 to communicate its exercise of the option.  Even
although such communication was not required to be in notarial form, it was
required to be in “written form”.  Furthermore the communication had to be made
on or before 27 July 1982.

Counsel for the appellant  correctly conceded that there was no communication of
the purported  exercise of the option before 27 July 1982 and that the option then
lapsed.  He sought, however, to rely on some sort of subsequent communication by
conduct which he called a “waiver”.  He argued that the subsequent communication
by conduct,  enabled one to conclude that the option was “revived”, as it were.  It
seems to me, as I put to counsel for the appellant during the course of his  argument
that one cannot “breathe life into a corpse”.  Van Heerden JA stated the matter in
these lucid terms in Trans-Natal Steenkoolkorporasie Bpk v Lombaard en ‘n Ander
1988(3) SA 625 at 639 I - 640 A:-
“Die opsie moes voor ‘n bepaalde datum uitgeoefen word.  By onstentenis
daarvan sou die bedingde aanbod tot verlenging outomaties verval.  Daar sou
dus nie meer ‘n reg kon wees waarvan die eiseresse  afstand kon doen nie.
Kortom, die eiseresse se “verpligting” om nie die aanbod te herroep nie en
die verweerder se ooreenstemmende reg om dit te aanvaar, sou uitgewerk
gewees het.  Gevolglik kon ‘n gepoogde afstanddoening na die sperdatum nie
herlewing van die verpligting en die reg tot gevolg gehad het nie.”
[20]    The decision in Neethling v Klopper en Andere 1967(4) SA 459 (A) to which
the appellant’s counsel referred does not assist the appellant.  In that  case  it was
held that the revival of a contract for the sale of land which had been terminated by
waiver of the rights which arose from the termination of the contract did not have
to comply with the formal requirements of section 1(1) of the Act.   This case is
distinguishable from the present case in that it  concerned the revival of an existing
contract, not the creation of a contract where none previously existed.  Here no

contract came into being.
[21]    In any event there is no specific allegation in the papers, by the appellant, to
the effect that there was a waiver.   In so far as it may be inferred from the papers
that there was such a waiver, there is no indication or averment that such waiver
took place by any person authorised by the respondent to waive his rights.
As the option lapsed it was no longer available to be turned into a mineral lease.  In
consequence thereof, no subsequent non-notarial circumstances may be relied upon
by the appellant as amounting to a fresh notarially executed contract.  This is
especially so in the light of the provisions of s 3(1) of the Act.
[22]    The fact that the parties or even one of them believe that there was a valid
contract is irrelevant (Fuls v Leslie Chrome (Pty) Ltd and Another 1962(4) SA
784(W) at 787 C - E).  Part performance by either or both of the parties cannot
make up for the need for notarial execution. (Wilken v Kohler 1913 AD 135 at 142
and 143).   Furthermore the fact that royalty payments were  formally agreed upon
between the parties and that such payments were made and accepted without
objection is also irrelevant (Fuls’ case (supra) at 787 E - F, Jolly v Herman’s
Executors 1903 TS 515 at 522 and Pucjlowski v Johnston’s Executors 1946 WLD
1 at 3).   It is  trite that parties may not, by private agreement, derogate from, or vary
or waive statutory requirements which are not intended to be exclusively for their
benefit.  This is so because the formality required by the statutory requirement  set

out in s 3(1) was introduced as a matter of public policy, and not for the benefit of
any class of person for example lessors or lessees (cf Wilken’s case (supra) at 142,
Hersch v Nel 1947(3) SA 365 (O) at 369 and Fuls’ case (supra) at 787H - 788C).
[23]    I conclude therefore that the appellant did not enter into a valid enforceable
mineral lease with the respondent.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.

STREICHER JA/

STREICHER JA
[1] 
The issue to be decided in this case is whether the
respondent repudiated an agreement of sale concluded between him
and the first appellant.
[2] 
In terms of the agreement of sale (Athe original
agreement@), which was concluded on 7 December 1996, the
respondent sold more or less 186,4 ha of land depicted on a sketch
plan (Athe property@) to the first appellant. The property was purchased
for the purpose of developing a golf course residential estate thereon.
The shares in the first appellant were held by the second, third and
fourth appellants who bound themselves as sureties in respect of the
obligations undertaken by the first appellant.
[3] 
The agreed purchase price was R126 073 per hectare and
was payable in 4 instalments, the first of which was payable against

transfer of the property. Clause 4 of the original agreement provided
that if upon survey the area of the property was found to be more or
less than 186,4 ha the purchase price and also the final instalment had
to be adjusted at the rate of R126 073 per hectare. In terms of clause
20.1 the first appellant had to engage at its cost the services of F. Pohl
and Partners, a firm of town planners, to prepare a development plan
in accordance with the provisions of the Hillcrest 2 Town Planning
Scheme to enable a Mr Levitt to apply for and obtain town planning
approval of the proposed golf course estate .
[4] 
In terms of clause 20.3 the first appellant appointed Levitt
in consultation with F Pohl and Partners to apply for town planning
approval of its development plan and Afor any town planning special
consent which may be required in pursuance of the development plan@.
All necessary information sufficient to enable Levitt to apply for the

said approval had, in terms of clause 20.2 to be lodged by the first
appellant with him within 60 days after signature of the original
agreement. The 60 day period was subsequently extended by the
respondent to 26 February 1997.
[5] 
At a meeting held on 11 February 1997 certain
adjustments to the boundaries of the property were discussed. The
adjustments consisted of the addition of three additional pieces of land
which came to be known as the sausage, the small triangle and the side
triangle, and the deduction of a piece of land which came to be known
as the big triangle. No agreement on the price payable in respect of the
additional land could be reached. Levitt, who at all relevant times
during the negotiations acted on behalf of the respondent, stated that
the price for the additions had to be R180 000 per hectare whereas the
deductions had to be priced at R126 073 per hectare. Mr Kroon, who

represented the first appellant, suggested a price of R126 073 per
hectare for the additions. According to Levitt, who deposed to the
founding affidavit filed by the respondent, Kroon, acting on behalf of
the first appellant, agreed to his terms during a subsequent telephone
conversation. Kroon denies that he agreed on a price of R180 000 per
hectare for the additional land.
[6] 
On 14 February 1997 the respondent wrote to the first
appellant as follows (Aannexure >L=@):
ASALE OF LAND AT HILLCREST

With regard to Mr R E Levitt=s verbal discussions with Mr H
Kroon I confirm that subject to what follows I am prepared at
your request to enter into an addendum to our agreement to
provide for:

1.
The sale to you of three pieces of land measured by F
Pohl and Partners and depicted on a plan handed to Mr
Levitt, said to be 5.4750 ha in extent, at R180 000 per
hectare: R985 500.
2.
The deduction of one piece of land from the property measured

and depicted as stated above, being estimated 2.2 ha at R126 073
per hectare: R277 360.
3.
A net addition to the purchase price of R708 140 (R985 500 -
R277 360) plus V.A.T.

My agreement to this variation is subject to the following conditions:

a.
The additional purchase price will be added pro rata to the sums
set out in clauses 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.1.4 of our agreement.
b.
Clause 4 will be amended so as to provide for any variation in the
area of the additional land now sold to be adjusted at R180 000 per
hectare.
c.
Apart from the necessary adjustments to clauses 3 and 4 all other
stipulations in the agreement remain unaltered and of full force
and effect.

Upon receipt of your written confirmation of these proposals I will arrange
for the addendum to be prepared for signature.@

Levitt alleges that this letter confirmed the verbal agreement which he had
reached with Kroon. This is denied by Kroon.
[7] 
In another letter of the same date to Mr Swemmer, the chief
executive officer of the second appellant, the respondent expressed concern about
proposals by the first appellant that the number of dwelling units in the
development be increased from 550 to 800.  Still on 14 February 1997 Swemmer,
in a letter to the respondent (Aannexure >N=@), said: AWe do not accept that you

expect us to agree to increase the footprint of the site to be purchased but not
agree that the number of stands be increased.@ He made no mention of the price
payable for the additions.
[8] 
In the minute of a meeting held on 18 February 1997 and attended
by representatives of the first appellant and the respondent, it was recorded: AMr
Herman Kroon referred to a letter dated 14 February 1997 regarding amendments
to the sale agreement, and mentioned that the relevant clause (sale agreement)
regarding the total area and cost of the property has to be amended accordingly
and signed@. According to Kroon there was no question at the meeting of the first
appellant having confirmed or accepted any particular price which had been put
forward by the respondent. The minute was drafted by Mr Brandt a partner in F
Pohl and Partners. According to him there was a dispute as to what the price
should be and no agreement was reached thereanent.  Kroon had merely referred
to the letter of 14 February 1997 and said that if agreement was reached on the
price, it would have to be reduced to writing and signed.
[9] 
Application was made for the approval of a development plan in

respect of the property with the additions and deduction to which I have referred
(Athe enlarged property@) and for the rezoning thereof. Copies of the draft
advertisements for the applications and of the report in motivation of the
application for rezoning were sent to Mr Pohl for comment. Pohl was acting on
behalf of the first appellant. On 1 March 1997 Levitt also sent two copies of the
applications to Kroon. No amendments were suggested by either Kroon or Pohl.
[10] 
In a letter dated 4 March 1997 the respondent contended that the
first appellant had agreed that the agreement of sale be amended as set out in the
above-quoted letter of 14 February 1997 but indicated his willingness to reduce
the purchase price from R25 365 622 to R24 932 315. The offer was not accepted
by the first appellant. Instead, Kroon suggested that the purchase price required by
the respondent be further reduced by an amount of R315 000. The suggestion was
rejected.
[11] 
The respondent, in a letter dated 25 March 1997, again claimed that

the first appellant had agreed that the original agreement be amended as set out in
the above-quoted letter of 14 February 1997 (annexure AL@) and repeated his
willingness to reduce the purchase price. He added that if the offer was not
accepted the matter would have to proceed according to the agreement of sale as
amended by the first appellant=s acceptance of the proposals set out in his letter
dated 14 February 1997 (Athe disputed agreement@). The offer was still not
accepted. In his reply to the respondent=s letter, on 27 March 1997, Kroon stated
that it would appear that the parties were unable to reach agreement on the price
per hectare to be applied to the land added to the land originally sold. He
suggested that negotiations be discontinued and said that a new application for
""use rights"" would have to be submitted. The respondent=s response is contained
in a letter dated 2 April 1997. He claimed that a firm agreement had been reached
on the price per hectare of land added or deducted and added: AThe present
applications for rezoning and for approval of your Development Plan are correctly
based upon the land which you have bought. These applications must proceed to
their final conclusion. Any action by you which delays or adversely affects the

prospects for the approval of the applications would be a breach of our
agreement.@ On 18 April 1997 and in a letter to the first appellant marked for the
attention of  Swemmer,  Levitt reiterated on behalf of the respondent that he was
adamant that the original agreement had been amended and stated that guarantees
for the full purchase price would be required in the near future. Kroon replied on
29 April 1997 that in view of the fact that the parties had not reached an
agreement concerning the land added to the property, the application for rezoning
should be amended without further delay as the appellants were not prepared to
run the risk of having the application considered and dealt with on the basis of an
incorrect property description. He suggested an urgent meeting between the
parties in a final endeavour to resolve what appeared to have become an impasse.
He stated that it was imperative that the plans forming part of the zoning
application be rectified without delay and that for that reason the meeting had to
take place without delay. In yet another letter to the first appellant, dated 9 May
1997, Levitt, on behalf of the respondent, again claimed that the original
agreement had been amended and requested the first appellant to deliver

guarantees for the four instalments payable in terms of the disputed agreement
within 7 days from the date of the letter. On 13 May 1997, in a letter marked
personal and addressed to Swemmer, Levitt threatened that his client, the
respondent, would institute proceedings against the first appellant for the
immediate payment of the full amount of the purchase price (as amended) in the
event of the guarantees not being delivered in terms of the disputed agreement. He
also stated that he believed that the claim for damages flowing from the breach
would be substantial.
[12] 
The first appellant thereupon cancelled the original agreement. In
the letter of cancellation, dated 15 May 1997 its attorneys said:
A2.
We acknowledge receipt on behalf of Highveld 7 and E G
Chapman Executive Holdings Limited of the letters written by
your attorney, Mr R E Levitt, to those parties and dated,
respectively, 9 May 1997 and 13 May 1997.
3.
Our instructions are that Highveld 7 has stated on a number of
occasions that no agreement to amend the contract of 7 December
1996 has been reached by the parties to that contract. Highveld 7
has also stated, more than once, that it is quite willing and able to
comply with the contract of 7 December 1996, and that it regards
itself, and you, as bound thereby. However, you have over the past
few months, and especially in your attorney=s abovementioned
letter of 9 May 1997, made it quite clear that you have no intention

whatsoever of complying with the contract of 7 December 1996
and that you require Highveld 7 to comply with the terms of a new
contract which you allege the parties entered into. You have,
consequently, clearly and unequivocally repudiated the contract of
7 December 1996. Highveld 7 has decided to accept your
repudiation and we hereby accept it on its behalf. The contract of 7
December 1996 is hereby cancelled.@

[13] 
Levitt promptly responded by letter dated 16 May 1997. He denied
that the respondent had repudiated the original agreement. He contended that the
first appellant=s proper course was to tender delivery of the guarantees covering
the purchase price stipulated in the original agreement and reiterated that
consensus had been reached on the purchase price of the three additional pieces of
land and the deduction of the fourth piece.
[14] 
The respondent thereupon instituted proceedings in the court a quo
in terms of which he asked for an order declaring that the original agreement as
amended by annexure AL@ and the first appellant=s letter of the same date
(annexure AN@) was of full force and effect and binding as between him and the
first appellant. In the alternative he asked for an order declaring that the original
agreement was binding and of full force and effect.

[15] 
The court a quo held that no amendment of the original agreement
had been proved. It held further that the respondent=s conduct did not amount to a
repudiation entitling the first appellant to cancel the original agreement. In the
result it declared that the original agreement was binding and of full force and
effect but granted leave to the appellants to appeal to this court.
[16] 
In this court counsel for the respondent conceded, as he had to do,
that the first appellant never agreed in writing to an amendment of the original
agreement and that in the light of the formalities prescribed by s 2 of the
Alienation of Land Act 68 of 1981 no legally binding agreement to amend the
original agreement had been entered into by the parties. He submitted, however,
that the respondent and the first appellant orally reached consensus on the terms of
an amendment to the original agreement; that the first appellant never placed in
issue the validity of the disputed agreement on the basis of non-compliance with
the statutory formalities; that although the respondent required the first appellant
to perform in terms of such consensus it cannot be said that the respondent would
have insisted on performance in terms of the disputed agreement had the first

appellant denied the existence of an agreement because of a failure to comply with
the statutory formalities; that the respondent had not breached any term of the
original agreement and had not indicated that it intended to do so; and that  the
respondent=s demand that the first appellant  perform in terms of the disputed
agreement could in the circumstances not be construed as a repudiation.
[17] 
It is apparent from the aforegoing that there is a dispute between
the parties as to whether oral consensus was reached in respect of the price
payable in respect of the three additional pieces of land. The evidence of Kroon
and Brandt that no consensus was reached at the meeting held on 18 February
1997 cannot be rejected on the papers. The confirmation in annexure AL@ by the
respondent that he was prepared to enter into an addendum to provide for the sale
of the three additional pieces of land and the deduction of another piece at the
price mentioned may simply have been a confirmation of the prices required by
the respondent and not of a consensus reached with Kroon.

It is
somewhat unlikely that the first appellant would have allowed the applications for

the approval of the development plan and for the rezoning of the enlarged
property to proceed before consensus in respect of the price payable was reached.
However, I am not satisfied that there is no real and genuine dispute of the facts
in question or that the appellants= allegations are so far-fetched or clearly
untenable as to warrant their rejection merely on the papers or that oral evidence
would not disturb the balance of probabilities appearing from the affidavits. None
of the parties required the matter to be referred to evidence. The matter therefore
has to be decided on the basis of the appellants= version that no consensus in
regard to the price payable in respect of the additions had been reached (see
Plascon-Evans Paints Ltd v Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd 1984 (3) SA 623 (A) at
634E-635C).
[18] 
In any event the respondent's attitude was that the first appellant
and he were contractually bound to one another in terms of the disputed
agreement and no longer in terms of the original agreement. It is on this basis:
That he said in his letter of 25 March 1997 that if his offer to
reduce the purchase price was not accepted the matter would have
to proceed according to the disputed agreement.

That, after Kroon had stated that the parties seemed to be unable to
reach agreement on the price per hectare to be applied to the land
added to or deducted, he said in his letter dated 2 April 1997 that a
firm agreement had been reached; that the applications for
rezoning and for approval of the development plan were correctly
based upon the land bought; and that any action which could delay
or adversely affect the prospects for the approval of the
applications would be a breach of the agreement.
That Levitt stated in his letter of 18 April 1997 that he was
adamant that the original agreement had been amended and that
guarantees for the full purchase price would be required in the near
future.
That, after Kroon had suggested that the application for rezoning
be amended as a matter of urgency and that an urgent meeting
between the parties should be held to resolve what appeared to
have become an impasse, he  claimed that the agreement had been

amended and that guarantees in terms of the amended agreement
should be delivered within 7 days.
That Levitt stated in his letter dated 13 May 1997 that the
respondent would institute proceedings against the first appellant
for the immediate payment of the full amount of the purchase price
(as amended) and for damages in the event of the guarantees not
being delivered in terms of the disputed agreement.
[19] 
The question to be decided is whether this attitude adopted by the
respondent constituted a repudiation. The test to determine whether conduct
amounts to a repudiation is whether fairly interpreted it exhibits a deliberate and
unequivocal intention no longer to be bound (see O K Bazaars (1929) Ltd v
Grosvenor Buildings (Pty) Ltd 1993 (3) SA 471 (A) at 480I - 481A).
[20] 
The court a quo held that the respondent had not evinced a
deliberate and unequivocal intention not to be bound by the original agreement.
Nicholson J stated that the modified contract was a relatively small addition and
subtraction from the original and that it was illogical to regard the respondent=s

insistence on the modified contract as a repudiation of the original contract. He
added that there was no suggestion that the respondent wanted the modified deal
or no deal at all. In this regard he referred to the letter written by Levitt the day
after the cancellation in which he denied that the respondent had repudiated the
original agreement. He said that the first appellant should have tendered delivery
of the guarantees covering the purchase price stipulated in the original agreement
whereupon the validity of the arrangements for the four pieces of land in issue
could have been tested by appropriate litigation.  The court a quo's judgment has
been reported (Bailes v Highveld 7 Properties (Pty)Ltd & Others 1998 (4) 42
(N)).
[21] Apart from the fact that it is a question of law, to be
decided by the court, whether the respondent=s conduct constituted a
repudiation, the test which has to be applied to determine whether the
original agreement was repudiated,  is an objective one. It follows that
even a bona fide, subjective intention not to repudiate the agreement

would not assist the respondent if he acted in such a way as to lead a
reasonable person to the conclusion that he did not intend to fulfil his
part of the original agreement. In Metalmil (Pty) Ltd v AECI
Explosives and Chemicals Ltd 1994 (3) SA 673 (A) Howie JA and
Mahomed AJA said at 684I - 685C:
AIt is probably correct to say that respondent was bona
fide in its interpretation of the agreement and that subjectively it
intended to be bound by the agreement and not to repudiate it.
This fact does not, however, preclude the conclusion that its
conduct constituted repudiation in law. Respondent was not
manifesting any intention to conduct its relations with appellant
and to discharge its duties to appellant in accordance with what
it was obliged to do on an objective interpretation of the
agreement. In effect, it was insisting on a different contract,
however bona fide it might have been in its belief that it was
not. As was stated by Lord Wright in the case of Ross T Smyth
& Co Ltd v T D Bailey, Son & Co [1940] 3 All ER 60 (HL) at
72B:

' I do not say that it is necessary to show that the party
alleged to have repudiated should have an actual
intention not to fulfil the contract. He may intend in fact
to fulfil it, but may be determined to do so only in a

manner substantially inconsistent with his obligations,
and not in any other way.'

The objective conduct of respondent in this case, in our

view, entitled appellant to cancel the contract on the
grounds that respondent had repudiated it even if respondent
believed that it was abiding by the contract.@

[22] Counsel for the respondent submitted that unless it could
be found that the respondent indicated that he would not be prepared
to comply with his obligations under the original agreement, if for any
reason the amendments proved to be ineffective, his conduct did not
constitute a repudiation.
[23] In this regard the respondent relies on two English cases
namely Spettabile Consorzio Veneziano Di Armamento e Navigazione
v Northumberland Shipbuilding Company Limited (1919) 121 LT 628
and Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK
Ltd [1980] 1 All ER 571 (HL). In Spettabile it was held that when one

party to a contract asks the court to declare whether or not he is bound
by a contract he does not thereby repudiate the contract. Atkin LJ, in
an appeal from the Queen=s Bench Division, said at 635:
AThe writ takes the form of asking for a declaration as to the
rights of the parties. I agree that it asks for alternative
declarations, and it asks for relief in addition to declarations.
But the substance of it appears to me to be this: that the
plaintiffs in the action are asking the court to declare whether or
not they are any longer bound by the contracts. It appears to me
that that is an entirely different state of facts altogether from an
intimation by the plaintiffs, apart from the courts of law, that
they in any event are not going to perform the contracts. It is
something quite different from a repudiation.@

[24] In Woodar Lord Wilberforce stated that in considering
whether there had been a repudiation by one party, it was necessary to
look at his conduct as a whole (574c). In that case Wimpey gave a
notice of rescission of a contract to Woodar. Wimpey was not entitled
to do so but it was accepted that Wimpey honestly believed that it was

entitled to rescind. Before service of the notice of recission the parties
discussed the matter. Wimpey contended that it was entitled to rescind
the contract. Woodar contended the contrary. The upshot of the
discussion was that Wimpey would serve a notice to rescind and that
Woodar would not regard it as a hostile act but would take Wimpey to
court and let the judge decide whether the contract could be rescinded
or not (574j - 575a). The assumption was that both sides would abide
the decision of the court (575e).  The House of Lords (Lord Salmon
and Lord Russell dissenting) held that Wimpey=s conduct did not
amount to a repudiation of the contract.
[25] Lord Wilberforce considered the notice of rescission to
be a neutral act consistent either with an intention to preserve, or with
an intention to abandon, the contract (574d). He was of the view that
the facts referred to above indicated that, objectively considered,

Wimpey had no intention of abandoning the contract. It is against this
background that he said (at 576c-d):
A(I)t would be a regrettable development of the law of contract
to hold that a party who bona fide relies on an express
stipulation in a contract in order to rescind or terminate a
contract should, by that fact alone, be treated as having
repudiated his contractual obligations if he turns out to be
mistaken as to his rights. Repudiation is a drastic conclusion
which should only be held to arise in clear cases of a refusal, in
a matter going to the root of the contract, to perform contractual
obligations.@

[26] Lord Keith was also of the view that Wimpey had not
repudiated the agreement, mainly because Wimpey served the notice
of rescission in the expectation that Woodar would initiate legal
proceedings in order to test its validity, without indicating in any way
that it would refuse performance in the event of a judicial
determination that its belief that it was entitled to do so, was erroneous
(587f-h). He stated in general at 588b-d:

AThe doctrine of repudiatory breach is largely founded on
considerations of convenience and the opportunities which it
affords for mitigating loss, as observed by Cockburn CJ in
Frost v Knight (1872) LR 7 Exh 111 at 114. It enables one party
to a contract, when faced with a clear indication by the other
that he does not intend to perform his obligations under it when
the time for performance arrives, to treat the contract, if he so
chooses, as there and then at an end and to claim damages as for
actual breach. Where one party, honestly but erroneously,
intimates to the other reliance on a term of a contract which, if
properly applicable, would entitle him lawfully to rescind the
contract, in circumstances which do not and are not reasonably
understood to infer that he will refuse to perform his obligations
even if it should be established that he is not so entitled, legal
proceedings to decide that issue being in contemplation, I do
not consider it in accordance with ordinary concepts of justice
that the other party should be allowed to treat such conduct as a
repudiation. Nor, in my opinion, are there any considerations of
convenience which favour that course.@

[27] Lord Scarman stated that the law required that not only
the party=s conduct but also, objectively considered, its impact on the
other party be assessed (590b). In this case Wimpey believed that it
was acting pursuant to the contract and Woodar never thought that if

Wimpey was held not to be entitled to give a notice of rescission it
would refuse to perform the contract (590d-e).
[28] In Wimpey the notice of rescission was given on the basis
that its validity would be tested in a court and that Wimpey would
perform in terms of the contract should the court decide against it. The
present case is quite different. Unlike in Wimpey the respondent's
attitude was not adopted on the basis that it was subject to correction.
He was quite adamant even after it must have become clear to him that
there was a dispute as to whether the original agreement had been
amended or not. Clause 3.3 of the original agreement required the first
appellant to deliver to the respondent guarantees for the payment of
the four instalments payable in terms of the agreement of sale within 7
days Aafter the fulfilment of the condition contained in 20"". The

condition referred to was the approval of the development plan and the
rezoning applications. The first of the instalments was payable against
registration of transfer of the property into the name of the first
appellant. The development plan in respect of the enlarged property
was approved on 16 April 1997 and the first appellant was advised of
the approval on 18 April 1997. No development plan in respect of the
property was approved. The respondent nevertheless insisted that
guarantees be delivered in respect of the amended purchase price, the
first of which was to be payable against registration of the land sold in
terms of the Aamended agreement of sale@.
[29] In my view, the respondent=s insistence that guarantees be
delivered in terms of the disputed agreement and his threats to
approach the court in order to compel the first appellant to deliver
such guarantees and to claim damages suffered as a result of the first

appellant having breached the disputed agreement by failing to deliver
such guarantees, would have led a reasonable person in the position of
the first appellant to the conclusion:
1.
That it would serve no purpose to apply for the approval of a
development plan and a rezoning in respect of the land sold in
terms of the original agreement;
2.
That it would serve no purpose to deliver guarantees for the
payment of the purchase price payable in terms of the original
agreement against transfer of the property.
3.
That the respondent would not transfer the land sold in terms of
the original agreement against performance by the first appellant
of its obligations in terms of that agreement.
[30] 
The respondent therefore unequivocally and deliberately made it
clear that he considered himself to be bound by the terms of the disputed
agreement and not by the original agreement which was in fact binding on him.
The agreements differed materially from one another both in respect of the

property sold and the purchase price. The respondent therefore repudiated the
original agreement.
[31] 
Counsel for the respondent submitted that if we were to find that
the first appellant repudiated the original agreement, no party could safely make a
demand or seek to enforce a contract as amended, without running the risk that if
its contentions regarding the amendment proved incorrect, the entire contract
could be cancelled even though it was perfectly willing to perform under the
contract as unamended and had never suggested that it would not do so. The result
contended for does not follow from the finding that the respondent repudiated the
original agreement. Firstly, the finding is based on the prior finding that the
respondent indicated that he was not willing to perform under the original
agreement. Secondly, each case has to be decided in the light of its particular
circumstances. An important consideration in the present case is that the
respondent persisted in his claim that the disputed agreement and not the original
agreement was binding on the parties. He did so even after it must have become

clear to him that the dispute in this regard could not be resolved by the parties
themselves, and without qualifying his claim by making it subject to correction by
a court or in any other way. When a party fails to perform an obligation in terms
of an agreement he breaches that agreement and it is no excuse for him to say that
he, because of some or other misapprehension on his part, thought that the
obligation was not due and that, had a court ruled against him, he would have
performed the obligation. There is no reason why the position should be different
where a party=s conduct exhibits a deliberate and unequivocal intention no longer
to be bound by an agreement (see Federal Commerce Navigation Co Ltd v
Molena Alpha Inc [1978] 3 All ER 1066 at 1082).
[32] 
The court a quo should therefore have dismissed the respondent=s
application. The appellants contended that they were entitled to the costs of two
counsel in this court as well as in the court a quo. In my view neither the appeal
nor the application in the court a quo required the services of two counsel.
The following order is made:
1.
The appeal is upheld with costs.

2.
The order made by the court a quo is set aside and the following
order is substituted therefor:
AThe application is dismissed with costs.@

JUDGMENT

OLIVIER JA
OLIVIER JA
[1] In these appeals, similar questions of law have been raised.   It is convenient to
deal with the appeals at one and the same time.
[2] It is common cause that Messrs Stopforth and Veenendaal (citizens of the
Republic of South Africa) were, during the incidents described herein, members of what
is generally referred to as right-wing Afrikaner organisations, inter alia the AWB
(Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging) and the Orde Boerevolk.   During or about 1989 they,
as well as one Klentz, were approached in the RSA by one Brown to participate in
underground terrorist activities in the territory then known as South West Africa
(“SWA”).   The three of them, as well as others, gathered in SWA, where they were
issued with weapons of war:  rifle grenades, anti-personnel and anti-tank missiles,
phosphorous grenades, explosive devices and rifles.   The Appellants and their
henchmen were in fact participating in the activities of a militant organisation based in
SWA known as Kontra 435 (a reference to the United Nations Resolution 435, the basis
of the independence process).   Attacks were planned against the offices of UNTAG
(the United Nations Task Force overseeing the transition to independence in Namibia)
at Outjo, the destruction of United Nations aircraft at the Windhoek Airport and other
attacks on United Nations sites.   The aim was to derail the impending general election
in SWA, being a precursor to independence.
[3] The attack on the Untag offices at Outjo was launched on 10 August 1989.

Stopforth and Veenendaal participated, both heavily armed.   A UN security guard and
a South West African policeman were killed and the Untag offices were damaged.
[4] They were arrested in SWA during September 1989.   On 4 December
1989 they escaped from custody and fled to the Republic of South Africa.   Namibia
gained its independence on 21 March 1990 and on that date achieved the status of a
Republic.   During June 1990 the Government of Namibia (the Third Respondent)
applied to the SA Government for the extradition of Stopforth and Veenendal, who were
then arrested and detained in South Africa until bail was granted pending the hearing
of the extradition application.
[5] The application was heard by Magistrate Roux in Johannesburg in terms of sec
10 read with sec 3 (2) of the South African Extradition Act, no 67 of 1962 (“the
Extradition Act”) there being no extradition agreement between the RSA and Namibia.
The matter was fully canvassed, both in fact and in law.   On 30 April 1992 Magistrate
Roux held in terms of sec 10 of the Extradition Act that the appellants were extraditable.
[6] Stopforth and Veenendaal failed to appeal against the magistrate’s order, and
their right to appeal lapsed.   In May 1992 they filed an application for condonation of
the late filing of notice to appeal, but abandoned their application.   As a consequence
of the magistrate’s order and the absence of an appeal the South African Minister of
Justice could, by virtue of sec 11 of the Extradition Act, either order or refuse the
surrender of Stopforth and Veenendaal to the Republic of Namibia,  subject to the
jurisdictional requirements described in that section.

[7] On 20 August 1992 a comprehensive memorandum was submitted by the
Appellants’ legal representative to the First Respondent’s predecessor, arguing that the
crimes committed by the Appellants were of a political nature and that Namibia did not
at the time of the commission of the offence constitute a foreign country.   The
submission also alleged that a fair trial would not be granted to the Appellants in
Namibia and it was furthermore contended that the available evidence would never
justify a conviction.   The First Respondent’s predecessor was advised by the legal
advisers of the Department of Justice that the Appellants should be extradited, but no
order was made by him.
[8] During September 1994 the First Respondent, after being appointed as the new
Minister of Justice, became aware of the issue which was still pending and requested
a comprehensive memorandum, which was presented to him.   The matter then was
allowed to simmer until 1996, when the Namibian  authorities directed a further enquiry
to the First Respondent.   The issue of the long delay which had occurred since August
1989 was specifically addressed.   The First Respondent then decided to surrender the
Appellants, and an order to this effect was issued by him on 10 October 1996.
[9] The Appellants made no application in terms of sec 14 (e) of the Extradition Act
to the High court for their discharge.
[10] On 21 November 1996 the Appellants applied to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission for amnesty for the incident at Outjo.  The applications were based on sec

18 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, 34 of 1995 (“the TRC
Act”).   In the applications they admitted inter alia to committing murder and damaging
property.   They averred that two persons died in the attack, viz Daniel Haasep, a UN
security guard, and Ricardo van Wyke, a member of the South West African police
force.
[11] The amnesty applications have not yet been heard by the Commission, but
indemnity has been granted to both the Appellants for other crimes committed by them
in the Republic of South Africa.   As far as the extradition to Namibia is concerned, the
sword of Damocles hangs over the heads of the Appellants.
[12] In November 1996 the Appellants launched motion proceedings in the then
Transvaal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa.   Apart from other,
consequential relief, two main prayers were advanced, viz
(a)
That the decision of the Minister of Justice of 10 October 1996 (ordering
their surrender for extradition to Namibia) be suspended pending the
adjudication by the Amnesty Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission of the amnesty applications; and
(b)
In the alternative, that the application made by the Government of
Namibia for the extradition (heard and decided by Magistrate Roux on 30
April 1992) be referred back (presumably to the said magistrate) in order
to establish whether a prima facie case had been made out.
[13] Only the First Respondent (the Minister of Justice) opposed the applications,

which were heard by Daniels J.   The learned judge dismissed both applications with
costs on 18 February 1997.   The court a quo came to the conclusion that the Second
Respondent, the Commission for Truth and Reconciliation (acting through the Amnesty
Committee), could not grant amnesty for deeds committed in Namibia, because it does
not have jurisdiction over crimes committed in SWA on 10 August 1989 as those crimes
could not be tried in South African courts.   The court a quo also held that section 20
of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, Act 34 of 1995 (“the TRC
Act”) was not applicable in the Appellants’ case, as Namibia could not be classified as
a “former state” of South Africa, unlike the TBVC states.
[14] The learned judge subsequently refused both Appellants leave to appeal to this
Court, but such leave was granted by this Court on 27 May 1997.
[15] It must be emphasized that the relief claimed by the Appellants is not a review
of the First Respondent’s decision to issue the order for the Appellants’ extradition.
No
such case was made out, and no such relief was claimed.   Nor are the Appellants
seeking to revive their lapsed right of appeal against the decision of the magistrate
given on 30 April 1992 that they are liable to extradition.   They apply neither for a right
to appeal, nor for their lapsed application for condonation of late noting of appeal to be
re-instated.   The Appellants’ case is simply that they have a right to apply for amnesty
in terms of the TRC Act;  that the relevant committee is competent to consider their
applications;  that at least prima facie there exists the possibility that amnesty will be
given for the offences committed at Outjo;  that if such amnesty is granted, they, the

Appellants, would either by operation of law or by virtue of a proper exercise of his
discretion by the Minister, not be extraditable or extradited to Namibia.   For the
purposes of this judgment I will assume, without deciding, the validity of the last-
mentioned submission.
[16] It was not argued by the First Respondent that the Appellants were not entitled
to apply for amnesty.   What was put in issue is the jurisdiction or competency of the
Committee on Amnesty to entertain and adjudicate upon the application.   This is the
point on which the matter was decided a quo, and the one which is decisive of the
appeal in the Stopforth matter.   I will later also deal with a further complication which
arose in  the Veenendaal appeal.
[17] The jurisdiction or competency of the Committee on Amnesty to consider
applications for amnesty is circumscribed by the TRC Act.   The basic principle for
granting amnesty as far as the act of an applicant is concerned, is that amnesty is
granted only for
... an act associated with a political objective...
(secs 18(1), 19(3)(a) and 20(1)(b) of the TRC Act).
The expression act associated with a political objective is defined in sec 20(2) of the
TRC Act as
... any act or omission which constitutes an offence or delict which,
according to the criteria in subsection (3), is associated with a political
objective, and which was advised, planned, directed, commanded,

ordered or committed within or outside the Republic during the period
1 March 1960 to the cut-off date, by ...
Subsection 20(2)(a) qualifies the broad scope of sec 20 (2).   I will deal presently
with these qualifications.
[18] For the purposes of this judgment I shall assume, without deciding, that the acts
committed by the Appellants in Outjo on 10 August 1989 were acts associated with
political objectives within the ordinary meaning of that expression.   But this will not
avail the Appellants if that expression as used in sec 20 (1) (b) and 20 (2) bears a
specific limited meaning which does not apply to the facts of this case.
[19] It is accordingly necessary to consider whether the TRC Act gives any
indication of a specific, limited meaning of the term “political objective” used in secs
20 (1) (b) and 20 (2), and whether there is any corresponding limit put on the actions
that are to be seen as achieving these political objectives?
Various provisions of theTRC Act impose such qualifications and limitations.
They are :
(1)
The act committed in effecting the political objective must be ... an
act or omission which constitutes an offence or delict ...  (sec 20 (2)).
(2)
The act must be ... associated with a political objective ... and must accord with
the criteria of subs (3).

(3)
The criteria mentioned in subs (3) to determine whether an act has a
political objective are :
(a)
The motive of the person who committed the act, omission or
offence;
(b)
the context in which the act, omission or offence took place,
and in particular whether the act, omission or offence was
committed in the course of or as part of a political uprising,
disturbance or event, or in reaction thereto;
(c)
the legal and factual nature of the act, omission or offence,
including the gravity of the act, omission or offence;
(d)
the object or objective of the act, omission or offence, and in
particular whether the act, omission or offence was primarily
directed at a political opponent or State property or personnel
or against private property or individuals;
(e)
whether the act, omission or offence was committed in the
execution of an order of, or on behalf of, or with the approval
of, the organisation, institution, liberation movement or body of
which the person who committed the act was a member, an
agent or a supporter; and
(f)
the relationship between the act, omission or offence and the
political objective pursued, and in particular the directness and
proximity of the relationship and the proportionality of the act,
omission or offence to the objective pursued, but does not
include any act, omission or offence committed by any person
referred to in subsection (2) who acted -

(i)
for personal gain: Provided that an act,
omission or offence by any person who acted
and received money or anything of value as
an informer of the State or a former state,
political organisation or liberation movement,
shall not be excluded only on the grounds of
that person having received money or
anything of value for his or her information; or
(ii)
out of personal malice, ill-will or spite, directed
against the victim of the acts committed.
(4)
The act in question must have been advised, planned, directed,
commanded, ordered or committed within or outside the
Republic (sec 20 (2)), (My emphasis);
(5)
The act must have been committed during the period 1 March
1960 to the cut-off date (sec 20 (2));

(6)
by
Any member or supporter of a publicly known political
organisation or liberation movement on behalf of or in
support of such organisation or movement,
(7)
bona fide in furtherance of a political struggle waged by such
organisation or movement;
(8)
against the State or any former State or another publicly known
political organisation or liberation movement.
(Sec 20 (2) (a), my italics)
I have already set out the facts as they appear in the record.   On these facts,
and applying the legal principles and statutory provisions enumerated above, will the
Amnesty Committee have jurisdiction to grant amnesty to the Appellants?
[20] On behalf of the Appellants it was argued that their applications comply with all
the requirements noted above.   In particular they placed reliance on the fact that the
acts for which amnesty is sought could have been committed ... within or outside the
Republic... (sec 20 (2)).   They argued that this phrase, far from qualifying or limiting the
jurisdiction of the Committee on Amnesty, extends its competency to cover acts such
as those committed by the Appellants in Outjo, SWA.   During argument reference was
made to what was termed “comparable political acts” by various groups and
organisations in the apartheid era in London, Paris, Botswana, Mozambique and
Lesotho.   These comparisons highlight the intricacy of the problem before us - but also
contain the key to its solution.

[21] In analysing the jurisdiction of the Amnesty Committee it is clear that a purposive
interpretation should be given to the TRC Act.   In Secretary for Inland Revenue v
Sturrock Sugar Farm (Pty) Ltd 1965 (1) SA 877 (A) at 903 Ogilvie Thompson JA made
it clear that
Even where the language is unambiguous, the
purpose of the Act and other wider contextual
considerations may be invoked in aid of a proper
construction.
And in Venter v R 1907 TS 910, Innes CJ at 914 expressed a similar
approach as follows
... it appears to me that the principle we should adopt
may be expressed somewhat in this way - that when to
give the plain words of the statute their ordinary
meaning would lead to absurdity so glaring that it
could never have been contemplated by the
legislature, or where it could lead to a result contrary
to the intention of the legislature, as shown by the
context or by such other considerations as the Court is
justified in taking into account, the Court may depart
from the ordinary effect of the words to the extent
necessary to remove the absurdity and to give effect
to the true intention of the legislature.
(See also R v Detody 1926 AD 198 at 202-203.)
In giving effect to this approach, one should, at least,
(i)
look at the preamble of the Act or at other express indications

in the Act as to the object that has to be achieved;
(ii)
study the various sections wherein the purpose may be found;
(ii)
look at what led to the enactment (not to show the meaning,
but to show the mischief the enactment was intended to deal
with);
(iv)
draw logical inferences from the context of the enactment.
(EA Kellaway, Principles of legal interpretation of statutes, contracts and
wills, Butterworths, Durban 1995 at 69; Jaga v Dönges NO and Another 1950 (4) SA
653 (A) at 662; In re Bidie 1949 Ch 121; Aetna Insurance Co v Minister of Justice 1960
(3) SA 273 (A) at 284.)   Part and parcel of this approach may well be the noscitur a
sociis rule (R v Jones 1925 AD 117 at 129).
[22] What appears from the preamble to the TRC Act is that amnesty is to be granted
in respect of acts, omissions and offences associated with political objectives
committed  ... in the course of the conflicts of the past.  (My emphasis).
The ... conflicts of the past ..., are, on a proper interpretation of the preamble,
conflicts between groups within the South African society.   The preamble clearly states
that the Constitution Act, 200 of 1993,
... provides a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided
society characterized by strife, conflict, untold suffering and
injustice, and a future founded on the recognition of human rights,
democracy and peaceful co-existence for all South Africans... (My
emphasis).
(See also the definition of ... gross violation of human rights ... in sec 1 (1) of the TRC Act.)

It further records that the Constitution states
... that the pursuit of national unity, the well-being of all South African
citizens and peace require reconciliation between people of South
Africa and the reconstruction of society.   (My emphasis)
It further states that amnesty shall be granted ... in order to advance such
reconciliation and reconstruction.  (My emphasis)
[23] In my view, the acts of the Appellants in SWA in 1989 were not part of the ...
conflicts of the past ... as intended in the TRC Act.   These acts were not directed
against South African opponents, e.g. liberation groups or political organisations
opposing the then government.   The Appellants went to SWA to lend support to a
conflict between political groups in that territory.   What is clearly intended by the TRC
Act is that the acts committed must have been associated with the conflicts of our
South African past.   They must have sprung from our deeply divided society.   The
envisaged amnesty must be given to reconcile opposing South African people.   An
internal conflict between groups in the South West African Society falls outside the
jurisdiction of the Amnesty Committee.   The acts committed by the Appellants did not
arise from our past - when these acts were committed the South African government
itself had accepted Resolution 435 and was co-operating with the UN to organise a free
and fair election.  Swapo, the liberation movement in SWA at the time, was not a role
player on the South African political scene.   In any event, the attacks by the Appellants
were not committed against Swapo.  To grant amnesty for the acts the Appellants
committed in Outjo would play no role in bringing about ... reconciliation between people of

South Africa.
[24] The above-mentioned conclusion is confirmed if one questions critically whether
the acts now under consideration were committed
... against the State or any former State or another publicly known
political organisation or liberation movement ... (sec 20 (2) (a)).
or
... in particular whether the act, omission or offence was primarily
directed at a political opponent or State property or personnel or
against private property or individuals ... (sec 20 (3) (d)).
[25] “State” is defined in the TRC Act as the Republic of South Africa.   It is common
cause that the Appellants had no intention of acting against the RSA; on the contrary
they thought that they were acting in its favour or interest.   They were, similarly, not
acting against the personnel of the RSA as meant by sec 20 (3) (d).
[26] “A former State” is defined in the TRC Act so as to include only the former so-
called independent States : Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei.   The
Appellants did not act against them.
[27] “Liberation movement” is not defined in the TRC Act.   The expression, in its
present context, means a political organisation or movement aimed at the liberation of
the oppressed masses from colonialism, apartheid and disenfranchisement.   Swapo
was clearly, at the time, such a movement.   But there is no evidence or allegation that
the Appellants intended to act or did in fact act against Swapo.   Their victim was the

UN, more particularly its peace force, Untag.   If Swapo had been the Appellants’ target,
they had ample opportunity of attacking Swapo’s offices, vehicles and personnel.  They
did not do so.   For the same reason, they were not acting against a “political opponent”
as meant by sec 20 (3) (d), nor were they acting against private property or individuals,
as meant by that section.   But even if this conclusion is considered  too narrow, and
one were to accept that their ultimate target was Swapo, their actions would still not be
part of the political past of our country.
[28] That leaves us only one last question : were the Appellants, in acting against the
Untag offices in Outjo, committing acts against ... another publicly known political organisation
... as meant by sec 20 (2) (a)?   Is the UN, represented by UNTAG, such an
organisation?
[29] That the UN is a ... publicly known political organisation ... in the general sense,
i.e. an organisation whose functions include that of attempting to influence state
policies in any field (cf Argus Printing and Publishing Co Ltd v Inkatha Freedom Party
1992 (3) SA 579 (A) at 586 D) is clear.   The UN was in 1989, as it is today, committed
to the furtherance of human rights protection in all countries of the world.   Where the
laws of a country are inimical to such protection (e.g. the then apartheid laws) the UN
endeavoured, by means of debates and resolutions, to procure changes in these laws,
the government policy and particular decisions of the government of that country.   The
UN would thus fall squarely within the ordinary meaning of ... publicly known political
organisation ....

[30] However, applying the approach outlined above, I am of the view that the UN,
then  represented by UNTAG, cannot be fairly said to be ...a publicly known political
organisation... for the purpose of sec 20 (2) (a) of the TRC Act.
[31] This latter conclusion is borne out if regard is had to sec 20 (2) (a).   This
requires the act to have been done against the State (defined as the Republic of South
Africa),  a former State, another publicly known political organisation or a liberation
movement.  (My emphasis)   Now why is the word another used?   The answer lies in
the first part of sec 20 (2) a : Amnesty can only be granted for acts committed by
... any member or supporter of a publicly known political organisation
or liberation movement.
against another similar group.
Sec 20 (2) (a) therefore envisages conflict between two opposing organisations or
groups, such as between the AWB and the ANC, or, in South West Africa, between
Kontra 435 and SWAPO.   The UN (or UNTAG) can by no stretch of the imagination
be reduced to the level of one of the opposing groups or organisations;  it is simply not
the same kind of organisation as Kontra 435, a terrorist group with which the Appellants
associated themselves.
[32] My conclusion is further borne out by sec 20 (3) (d) of the TRC Act.   It requires
the Amnesty Committee to consider

... in particular whether the act, omission or offence was primarily
directed at a political opponent or State property or personnel or
against private property or individuals.  (My emphasis).
The UN (or UNTAG), against which the Appellants directed their acts, cannot properly
be described as ...a  political opponent ....   Nor were the acts directed at the South
African State or its personnel, or against any private property or individuals in the
course of opposing an opponent or as part of the South African conflicts of the past.
[33] For the above reasons, the Amnesty Committee is not competent to grant
amnesty to the Appellants as sought by them.
[34] There is also an alternative way by which the same conclusion can be reached.
The offences in respect of which the extradition of the Appellants is sought are
murder, theft and the unlawful possession of a machine gun, hand and rifle grenades
and explosives, committed in SWA.   A South African court will only have jurisdiction
to try persons accused of committing crimes if the offences were committed within
South Africa and in general if they were committed in the court’s territorial area of
jurisdiction.    An exception to this rule is the so-called extra-territorial offences, such
as treason for which a person may be prosecuted in South Africa even if the offence
was committed abroad.   The offences committed by the Appellants in Outjo do not fall
into the class of extra-territorial crimes.   It follows that no South African court has
jurisdiction to try the Appellants for the offences for which their extradition is sought.

[35] In my opinion it is clear that Parliament could never have intended to confer on
the Amnesty Committee the power to grant amnesty in respect of offences committed
outside South Africa which are not triable in this country but in another country in which
any amnesty purportedly conferred by the Amnesty Committee would not be
recognised.   The power conferred on the Committee to grant amnesty in respect of
offences committed outside South Africa can, in my view, only be exercised in respect
of so-called extra-territorial offences triable in this country.   The crimes committed by
the Appellants at Outjo do not belong to the latter category.
[36] In the result, I am of the view that the Amnesty Committee is not competent to
grant the Appellants amnesty for the deeds they committed on 10 August 1989 in Outjo,
South West Africa.   To suspend the extradition order authorised by the Minister of
Justice on 10 October 1996 in order to enable them to approach the Amnesty
Committee would be futile.   The main prayer in the Notice of Motion was correctly
refused by the court a quo.
[37] The alternative prayer was that the extradition application made by the
Government of Namibia be referred back (I presume : to the said magistrate) in order
to establish whether a prima facie had been made out.
The request has no basis in law or in fact.   Magistrate Roux had already
conducted the enquiry in terms of the Extradition Act and made an order in terms of sec
10 thereof.   A prerequisite for such an order was that the magistrate had to find of an
accused

... that there would be sufficient reason for putting him on trial for the
offence, had it been committed in the Republic.
Implicit in the order made by the magistrate is that he had made such finding.   There
was no appeal against this order.   Counsel for Stopforth could not indicate on what
legal basis the matter can now be referred back to the magistrate, who is now functus
officio.
For these reasons, the second prayer was rightly refused by the court a quo.
In the result, the appeal by Stopforth must be refused.
THE VEENENDAAL APPEAL
[38] When the matter was called in this Court, an attorney, Mr Mostert, appeared for
Veenendaal.   He confirmed newspaper reports that his client had stolen a car and fled
the country.   Mr Mostert confirmed that his client was not prepared to countenance the
present governmental system any longer, that he had left the country, and that Interpol
was looking for him.   Mr Mostert quite properly conceded that his client was, under the
circumstances, a fugitive from justice.
[39] In the result, Veenendaal has no right  to be heard in the appeal.   Were he to
be heard, the court
... would be stultifying its own process, and it would, moreover, be
conniving at and condoning the conduct of a person who, through his
flight from justice, set law and order at defiance.

(Mulligan v Mulligan 1925 WLD 164 at 168; see also, in respect of appeals, S v Nkosi,
1963 (4) SA 87 (T) and S v Moshesh and Others, 1973 (3) SA 962 (A.)   No reason was
advanced why this general rule even if subject to exceptions, a matter I need not
decide,  should not be applied in Veenendaal’s case.   There having been appearance
for the appellant, the correct order seems to be that the appeal should be struck off the
roll, with costs.
[40] The following orders are made :-
The Stopforth appeal is dismissed with costs, such costs to include the costs of
two counsel.
The Veenendaal appeal is struck off the roll with costs, such costs to include the
costs of two counsel.

VERHOOR :

24   AUGUSTUS 1999

GELEWER :

21  SEPTEMBER 1999

U I T S P R A A K

VIVIER    AR:

Om ongeveer tienuur die aand van 17 Junie 1992 het =n paar honderd
mans, gewapen met vuurwapens,  assegaaie en kieries, die woonbuurt
Boipatong en die aangrensende plakkerskamp,  Slovopark,  binnegeval,
eiendom beskadig en geplunder en inwoners beseer en gedood.
Voortspruitende uit hierdie gebeure het 74 beskuldigdes voor Smit R
in die Transvaalse Provinsiale Afdeling tereggestaan op 45 aanklagte van
moord,  een aanklag van openbare geweld,   22 aanklagte van poging tot
moord  en 85 aanklagte van opsetlike saakbeskadiging.     By die aanvang van
die verhoor is die saak teen 42 beskuldigdes teruggetrek.       Aan die einde
van die Staatsaak is beskuldigdes 44 en 45 op alle aanklagte onskuldig bevind
en ontslaan.   Beskuldigdes 39 en 67 is tydens die verhoor oorlede.   Van die
oorblywende 28 beskuldigdes is beskuldigdes 2, 9, 14, 31, 36, 55, 58, 59, 60,
62, 64, 65, 68, 70, 71, 73 en 74, na wie ek hierna as Adie beskuldigdes@ sal
verwys,   skuldig bevind aan al 45 aanklagte van moord, die aanklag van

openbare geweld  en aan 14 aanklagte van poging tot moord (aanklagte 47, 48,
50, 55, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 64, 65, 66, 67 en 68).  Hulle is tot verskillende
tydperke van gevangenisstraf gevonnis.      Met die verlof van hierdie Hof
appelleer die beskuldigdes slegs teen hul skuldigbevindings.
Die pleging van die misdade waaraan die beskuldigdes skuldig bevind
is, was nie voor ons in geskil nie.    Wat wel in geskil was, was die identiteit
van die deelnemers aan die aanval.     Die beskuldigdes se verweer was dat
hulle nie deelgeneem het aan die aanval nie, dat hulle nie die betrokke aand in
Boipatong was nie en niks van die pleging van die misdade weet nie.
Die Staatsaak was dat die beskuldigdes ten tyde van die aanval almal
inwoners was van die KwaMadala hostel (AKwaMadala@)   wat geleë is
ongeveer een kilometer ten weste van  Boipatong binne die gronde van Iscor
naby Vanderbijlpark.     Tussen KwaMadala en Boipatong is =n oop veld.
Ongeveer in die middel van die oop veld loop =n teerpad van suid na noord

tussen Vanderbijlpark en Vereeniging  wat bekend staan as  Frikkie Meyer
Boulevard.      Aan die noordekant van Boipatong loop =n ander teerpad van
wes na oos wat  Frikkie Meyer Boulevard reghoekig kruis en wat bekend staan
as Nobel Boulevard.   Aan die noordekant van Nobel Boulevard is verskeie
nywerheidsgeboue,   een waarvan dié van Cape Gate is.
Die getuienis omtrent die ontstaan en ontwikkeling  van KwaMadala
was nie in geskil nie.        KwaMadala is aanvanklik opgerig vir werknemers
van Iscor.   Na die voltooiing van die KwaMazisa hostel in Sebokeng
gedurende die sewentigerjare is KwaMadala gesluit en die inwoners na
KwaMazisa oorgeplaas.    Nadat  onluste gedurende 1990 tussen lede van die
Inkatha Vryheidsparty  (AInkatha@)  en die ANC in Sebokeng uitgebreek het,
het sommige inwoners van KwaMazisa weer in KwaMadala gaan woon.
Hulle is gevolg deur Inkatha-ondersteuners uit ander hostelle en  omringende
woonbuurte wat vir hul veiligheid gevrees het.    Baie van hierdie mense was

nie Iscor-werknemers nie.  Ten tyde van die pleging van die huidige misdade
was daar ongeveer 600 na 700 inwoners by KwaMadala, waarvan maar
ongeveer die helfte by Iscor  gewerk het.    Voor die gebeure van 17 Junie
1992  was daar vir geruime tyd konflik tussen ondersteuners van die ANC en
Inkatha in woonbuurte  in die omgewing.  Feitlik sonder uitsondering was die
getuienis van die beskuldigdes en ander  inwoners van KwaMadala by die
verhoor dat hulle Zoeloes en/of Inkatha ondersteuners was en dat hulle by
KwaMadala gaan woon het nadat hulle  moeilikheid met ondersteuners van
die ANC ondervind het.   Terwyl KwaMadala gevolglik tot =n toevlugsoord vir
Zoeloes en Inkatha ondersteuners ontwikkel het, was die meerderheid van die
inwoners van Boipatong en Slovopark ANC ondersteuners of simpatiseerders.
Vir die uitkenning van die beskuldigdes as deelnemers aan die aanval
het die Staat hoofsaaklik op die getuienis van drie medepligtiges gesteun.
Isaac Moswabudi Bojosi (ABojosi@) het getuig dat hy sedert 22 April 1992 in

KwaMadala gewoon het.    Hy ken al die beskuldigdes.    Hy het beskuldigdes
2, 9, 14, 31, 55, 58, 62, 65, 68, 71, 73 en 74  by vergaderings van die
inwoners van KwaMadala leer ken.    Beskuldigde 36  het hy leer ken toe
laasgenoemde hom gehelp het  om die kamer wat aan hom toegewys is, skoon
te maak.  Beskuldigde 59  het =n kamer met hom gedeel.    Beskuldigde 60 het
hy geken nog voordat hy na KwaMadala gekom het.   Hulle het aanvanklik =n
kamer in KwaMadala gedeel maar hy  het later =n ander kamer gekry en
beskuldigde 60 het toe by die   vorige   kamer  agtergebly.    Beskuldigde 64
het in =n kamer langs dié van Bojosi se broer gewoon.    Beskuldigde 70 het hy
reeds ongeveer vyf jaar vantevore ontmoet.
Bojosi het getuig dat =n komitee van tien lede die inwoners se
gemeenskaplike sake behartig het.      Beskuldigde 73 was die president,
beskuldigdes 2 en 9 die gesamentlike voorsitters en beskuldigde 58 die
sekretaris van die komitee.   Beskuldigde 9 was verder die indoena van die

sogenaamde Mbotho-groep van ou manne en beskuldigde 2 was die leier van
die jeug.
Bojosi het getuig dat hy die eerste keer van die beplande aanval op
Boipatong gehoor het by =n vergadering van inwoners wat by die stadion op
die binneplein van KwaMadala  gehou is ongeveer =n week of twee voor 17
Junie 1992.    By hierdie vergadering het beskuldigdes 2 en 73  eerste die
inwoners toegespreek oor =n byeenkoms wat by Jabulani gehou sou word.
Daarna is die dames gevra om die vergadering te verlaat en toe het
beskuldigde 9 aan die woord gekom.     Hy het gesê dat die inwoners hulle
gereed moes maak om =n aanval op Boipatong te loods in weerwraak vir die
aanvalle wat vantevore op die inwoners van KwaMadala gemaak  is.    Hy het
verder gesê dat diegene wat vuurwapens wou hê,  hul name by die hek moes
gaan opgee.     Beskuldigdes  31, 62, 68, 70 en 73 was ook by die vergadering.
Die Verhoorhof, wat deurgaans die medepligtiges se getuienis met groot

versigtigheid benader het,  het bevind dat daar by gebrek aan  stawing vir
Bojosi se getuienis oor hierdie vergadering  dit buite rekening gelaat moet
word.
Bojosi het verder getuig dat sommige  van die inwoners  hul eie
vuurwapens gehad het en dat daar  twee AK-47 gewere in =n stoorkamer
versteek  was wat hy op =n dag gesien het toe beskuldigde 73 hom daarheen
geneem het om =n mat te gaan haal.  Geld is gereeld van die inwoners
ingesamel  vir uitgawes soos begrafniskoste en dies meer en sy indruk was dat
vuurwapens aangekoop is van die geld wat oorbly.    So het beskuldigde 70 op
=n dag sy voertuig geleen om vuurwapens te gaan koop.
Bojosi het getuig dat hy die  aand van 17 Junie 1992 in sy kamer was
wat hy  met onder andere beskuldigde 59 gedeel het,  toe die sirene drie keer
afgaan wat =n teken was dat die inwoners moes vergader.    Een van die

inwoners het hom terselfdertyd aangesê  om =n   wapen saam te vat.   Hy het =n
stuk yster geneem  en na die stadion gegaan  waar hy ongeveer 300 van die
inwoners aangetref het.  Beskuldigde 9 het almal beveel om hul wapens te
gaan haal.   Die inwoners is aangesê om =n muti wat Ntelezi genoem word, te
drink wat  beskuldigde 9 uit groot plastiese houers geskink het.    Beskuldigde
31   het  van die muti op die inwoners gesprinkel.     Daar is gesê dat die
gebruik van die muti  hulle dapper sou maak en dat dit sou verhinder dat hulle
raak geskiet word.  Almal is  aangesê om wit bandjies om hulle koppe  te bind.
Ene Damara het by die stadion in =n voertuig aangekom waaruit hy en
beskuldigde 9 =n aantal   AK-47 gewere gehaal  het wat hulle aan verskillende
mense, onder andere beskuldigde  2, oorhandig het.  Beskuldigde 9 het een
van die wapens vir homself gehou.  Beskuldigde 70 het ook =n  AK-47 gedra
en gesê dat hy =n sekere persoon in Boipatong wou skiet.  Bojosi het gevolglik
vir beskuldigde 68 gevra om die geweer by beskuldigde 70 af te neem.   Hy

weet nie of beskuldigde 68 dit gedoen het nie.
Bojosi het voorts getuig dat om ongeveer halftien die betrokke aand  >n
groep van ongeveer 350 tot 400 inwoners van KwaMadala vertrek het na
Boipatong.  Hy was saam met die groep.   Toe hulle by die hoofhek van die
kompleks uitgaan,  het hy vir beskuldigde 73 by die hek sien staan.   Die groep
het oor Frikkie Meyer Boulevard beweeg  en by =n boom in die oop  veld wes
van Boipatong in twee kleiner groepe verdeel.     Terwyl hulle Frikkie Meyer
Boulevard  kruis,  het >n voertuig daar >n U-draai voor hulle gemaak.    In sy
groep was beskuldigde 2 een van dié wat heel voor geloop het.    Hulle het
Boipatong  langs  Moshoeshoestraat binnegegaan en op die hoek van Lekoa-
en Moshoeshoestrate het =n groep van die Boipatong-inwoners op hulle
geskiet.   Hulle het teruggeskiet en die Boipatong-inwoners het gevlug.
Beskuldigde 9 is een van drie lede van hulle groep wat op die Boipatong-

inwoners geskiet het met =n  AK-47.    Onder kruisverhoor het Bojosi sy
getuienis verander en gesê dat hy die eerste keer die betrokke aand gesien het
dat  beskuldigde 9  =n vuurwapen  het toe hulle by Boipatong uitkom.    Na die
aanvanklike skietery het  die invallers  opbeweeg in Lekoastraat en na huise
geskiet en vensters stukkend geslaan.  Beskuldigde 74 het met =n haelgeweer
geskiet.       Vanuit Lekoastraat het hulle  regs gedraai in Bapedistraat en
daarna links in Senqustraat waar ene Zondo se taverne geplunder is.
Beskuldigde 14 was een van die wat by die taverne was.     Uit Senqustraat het
hulle regs gedraai in Batsoanastraat.  Bojosi was nie presies seker van hul
bewegings daarna nie,  maar volgens hom het sy groep op =n stadium in
Tugelastraat aan die oostekant van Boipatong beweeg van waar hulle weer
terug beweeg het in Lekoastraat tot by die kruising met  Hlubistraat waar =n
hoekhuis en =n voertuig geplunder is.    Bojosi het vir beide beskuldigdes 64
en 65 op die perseel van hierdie huis gesien. Laasgenoemde het =n 7,65 pistool

gedra.     Daarvandaan het hulle langs Hlubistraat tot in Bafokengstraat
beweeg en daarna tot in  Thembastraat aan die noordekant van Boipatong
waar die ander groep by hulle aangesluit het.  Daarvandaan is hulle direk terug
na KwaMadala en teen halfelf die aand was Bojosi terug in sy kamer.
Bojosi het getuig dat by een van die huise waarvan hulle die vensters
stukkend geslaan het, het  beskuldigde 59 =n persoon wat probeer  ontvlug het,
met =n haelgeweer platgeskiet.   Dié  haelgeweer het =n sekere merk op die kolf
gehad.   Volgens Bojosi was daar drie sulke gemerkte gewere in KwaMadala.
By Hlubistraat 773 is =n Sierra-voertuig beskadig.   Een het die bandspeler
probeer verwyder, =n ander het die brandstoftenk met =n spies stukkend gesteek
en =n derde het die ruite gebreek.  In Tugelastraat het hulle =n Peugeot-voertuig
teengekom.   Die insittendes het uitgespring en gevlug.  Beskuldigde 62 het
een van die voortvlugtendes met =n spies in die hand gejaag,  teruggekom en
die Peugeot  se bande met die spies stukkend gesteek.  Beskuldigde 14 het =n

groot sak gedra toe hulle Boipatong verlaat het.     Bojosi het nie vir
beskuldigde 31 gedurende die aanval gesien nie,  maar toe hy Ntelezi op die
ander gesprinkel het,  het hy =n spies en =n kierie gehad.    Beskuldigde 58 het
ook =n spies en =n kierie by die stadion gehad maar Bojosi het hom nie ten tyde
van die inval gesien nie.   Later in sy getuienis het Bojosi gesê dat hy nie kan
onthou of beskuldigde 58 by die stadion gewapen was of  nie.     Terwyl hulle
vir die ander gewag het buite Boipatong na die aanval het hy vir beskuldigde
60 met  =n Z 88-handwapen  in sy hand gesien.        Vir beskuldigde 68  het hy
nie gedurende die aanval gesien nie.      Bojosi het gesien dat beskuldigde 70
gewapen was met =n   AK-47 op pad na Boipatong.  Vir beskuldigde 73 het hy
nie weer gesien nadat hulle KwaMadala verlaat het nie.
Bojosi het getuig dat die dag na die aanval daar weer =n vergadering van
inwoners gehou is by die stadion wat deur ene Themba Khosa, ene Humphrey
Ndlovu en beskuldigde 58 toegespreek is.   Beskuldigde 58 het gesê dat  al die

goed wat in Boipatong geroof is,  bymekaar gebring en verbrand moes word.
Dit is daarna gedoen.     Later in sy getuienis het Bojosi gesê dat dit nie
beskuldigde 58 is wat so gesê het nie maar ene Khumalo.    Bojosi het getuig
dat beskuldigde  71  gehelp het met die insameling en verbranding van die
goed.   Tydens =n gesprek daardie dag oor die aanval op Boipatong het
beskuldigde 36 gespog dat hy =n persoon gesteek het tydens die aanval.
Bojosi is op 3 Augustus 1992 gearresteer en later dieselfde dag het hy =n
verklaring aan die polisie gemaak waarin hy onder andere die volgende gesê
het:
ABy Boipatong is ons gesê dat die wat nie wapens het nie,
moet skei van die wat wapens het.    Die sonder wapens is
aan die onderkant van die lokasie langs die skool gestuur
saam met plus-minus 4 gewapende mans.  Hulle moes kyk
dat ons nie aangeval word nie.  ...   Ons het begin vensters
breek met klippe wat ons langs die pad opgetel het.    Ek
het nie gesien of die ander met wapens iemand gesteek het

nie.   Ons het net vensters gebreek.@

Die volgende dag, 4 Augustus 1992,  het Bojosi =n verklaring voor =n landdros
gemaak wat in  breë trekke ooreenstem met sy verklaring aan die polisie.
Die verklaring, wat opvallend geen name noem nie, verskil wesenlik van
Bojosi se getuienis by die verhoor.     Bojosi het toe  gesê dat die verklarings
alles leuens was omdat  hy  net vrygelaat wou word.
Die tweede medepligtige wat by die verhoor getuig het,  was Kgobi
Oupa Moloi (AMoloi@).  Volgens hom het hy sedert Januarie 1992 in
KwaMadala gewoon.     Hy het vir beskuldigde 14  reeds voorheen geken en
daar was toe  moeilikheid tussen  hulle.   Beskuldigde 14 het  hom met =n
hamer op die kop gekap en wou hy vir beskuldigde 14 met =n skroewedraaier
steek.   Beskuldigde 74 was op daardie stadium =n polisieman en hy het vrede
gemaak tussen Moloi en beskuldigde 14.     Hy het ook vir beskuldigde 65
voorheen  geken.    Die orige beskuldigdes het hy almal leer ken by

KwaMadala.   Beskuldigde 2 was die leier van die jeug en beskuldigde 9 =n
indoena.

Moloi het getuig dat hy die aand van 17 Junie 1992 by =n drinkplek in
KwaMadala was toe die sirene afgaan wat =n teken was  dat die inwoners moet
vergader.  Hy en die ander mense by die drinkplek het nie reageer nie en
beskuldigde 58 het hulle  kom roep om na die vergadering te gaan.   Hy is na
die stadion waar reeds  baie mense was.     Die inwoners is aangesê om
Boipatong te gaan aanval.    Beskuldigde 9 het gesê dat almal hul wapens
moes gaan haal.    Beskuldigde 58 het gesê dat hulle wit lappies om hul  koppe
moes bind.    Moloi het =n kierie gaan haal.  Toe die mense  terugkom met
wapens is hulle met Ntelezi besprinkel deur beskuldigdes  9, 58 en 73.
Beskuldigde 74 het aan Moloi gesê  dat hy nie kan saamgaan nie omdat  die

mense in Boipatong hom ken.  Beskuldigde 73 het  gesê dat hy vyf AK-47=s
het.      Beskuldigdes  2 en 58 het elkeen een daarvan geneem.     Beskuldigde
59 en twee ander het elk =n haelgeweer gehad.    Beskuldigde 58 het aan Moloi
gesê dat omdat hy Afrikaans kan praat hy voor moes loop sodat  hy aan die
polisie kon sê,  indien hulle voorgekeer word,  dat die comrades  hulle
aangeval het en dat hulle  besig was om die comrades weg te jaag.  Voordat
hulle KwaMadala verlaat het, het Moloi  verder gesien dat beskuldigdes 60 en
65 elkeen met =n kierie,   beskuldigdes 55 en 62 elkeen met =n assegaai en
beskuldigdes 64 en 68 elkeen met =n pistool gewapen was. Beskuldigde 70 het
=n  AK-47 gehad.   Moloi het getuig dat  hulle kort voor tienuur die aand
KwaMadala verlaat het op pad na Boipatong.    Beskuldigde 9 het voor
geloop.   Hulle was ongeveer 200 na 250 mense.     Hulle het tot by =n sekere
plek in die veld gestap waar beskuldigdes 9 en 31 gesê het dat hulle  vir die
ander moes wag.  Nadat nog mense by hulle aangesluit het, is hulle na

Boipatong.     Op die hoek van Moshoeshoe- en Lekoastrate het =n groepie
comrades op hulle geskiet en drie van hulle, waaronder beskuldigde 9, het
teruggeskiet, waarop die comrades  weggehardloop het.    Die aanvallers het
versprei en deur Boipatong beweeg terwyl hulle die vensters van huise met
klippe stukkend  gooi,  by sommige huise ingaan en plunder en mense
doodmaak en beseer.   In Tugelastraat het hy self die vensters van =n Peugeot
stukkend geslaan.   Moloi het in fyn besonderhede beskryf hoedat beskuldigde
71 in =n huis in Hlubistraat =n vrou en =n kind met =n assegaai doodgesteek het
terwyl beskuldigde 67 (wat tydens die verhoor oorlede is) =n  ander kind met
=n 9 mm pistool doodgeskiet het.  Hy het beskryf hoe hy die ma van die een
kind in =n hangkas in =n ander vertrek gekry het en hoe hy =n fiets by daardie
huis gesteel het.    Hy het gesien dat beskuldigde 2 =n  perseel, wat later
geïdentifiseer is as Bafokengstraat 805,  verlaat.   Beskuldigde 36, gewapen
met =n assegaai, het saam met Moloi by =n sekere perseel ingegaan.

Beskuldigde 70 het by =n ander huis ingegaan met =n AK-47 in die hand.   Die
huis op die hoek van Hlubi- en Bafonkengstrate is aan die brand gesteek.   Hy
het  gesien dat beskuldigde 64 Boipatong met gesteelde goed  verlaat.    Die
aanvallers is  met dieselfde roete terug na KwaMadala.    By die hoofhek het
hulle vir beskuldigde 73 gekry.
Moloi het voorts getuig dat die dag na die aanval hy die gebeure met
beskuldigdes 36, 59 en 65 bespreek het terwyl hulle bier gedrink het.
Beskuldigde 36 het toe gesê dat sy Aassegaai iemand opgeëet het@.
Beskuldigde 59 het gesê dat hy =n kind met sy haelgeweer geskiet het en
beskuldigde 65 het bygevoeg dat hy iemand verkrag het.   Dieselfde dag het
die polisie die kamers deursoek en beslag gelê op wapens.   In beskuldigde 14
se kamer het hulle =n TV-stel,  =n video-masjien, =n   M-Net dekodeerder en =n
hoëtroustel gekry wat beskuldigde 14 gedurende die aanval in Boipatong
gesteel het.   Moloi  het so heftig beswaar gemaak dat die polisie dit net daar

gelaat het.   By =n vergadering van inwoners van KwaMadala daardie dag het
beskuldigdes 9 en 73 gesê dat al die goed wat by Boipatong geroof is,
verbrand moes word.   Moloi en beskuldigdes 31 en 64 het gehelp om  die
goed bymekaar te maak en te verbrand.
Moloi het getuig dat daar voor die aanval vuurwapens  onder die grond
en in =n kantoor by KwaMadala versteek was.     By =n vergadering van
inwoners is gesê dat nog vuurwapens aangekoop moes word met geld wat van
die inwoners gekollekteer is.
Moloi het getuig dat hy op 3 Augustus 1992 gearresteer is en dat hy
dieselfde dag =n verklaring aan =n landdros gemaak het.   Op 6 Augustus 1992
het hy ingewillig om vir die Staat te getuig.     Sedertdien was hy in
beskermende aanhouding.   Sy verklaring stem in wesenlike opsigte ooreen
met sy getuienis alhoewel geen name daarin genoem word nie.
Hy het in sy getuienis verduidelik dat hy nie die name van die

aanvallers in die verklaring genoem het nie omdat hy nog Adeurmekaar in die
kop@ was van die gebeure van die betrokke aand en omdat hy bang was.
Die laaste medepligtige wat getuig het,  was Eugenius Ntobeka Mnqithi
(AMnqithi@).    Sy getuienis was dat alhoewel hy aan die aanval deelgeneem
het, hy nooit gearresteer of in aanhouding was vir sy deelname nie en dat hy
self na vore gekom en sy getuienis aan die Staat aangebied het.
Mnqithi het getuig dat hy en ene Shimi, ene Todi en =n paar meisies
saam met  Bojosi in =n kamer in KwaMadala gewoon het.   Kort voor agtuur
die aand van 17 Junie 1992 het die sirene wat =n vergadering afkondig, gelui
en die mans is na die stadion waar beskuldigde 9 besig was om die inwoners
toe te spreek.   Beskuldigde 9 het gesê dat hulle Boipatong moes gaan aanval
en dat hulle wapens moes gaan haal vir daardie doel.   Beskuldigde 9 het
bygevoeg dat hy vier AK-47=s by hom het.     Beskuldigde 9 het ook gesê dat

hulle wit doeke om hul koppe moes bind.  Beskuldigde 2 het =n AK-47 in sy
hand gehad.    Almal het daarna opgestaan, wapens gaan haal en teruggekeer
na die stadion waar hulle met Ntelezi besprinkel is deur beskuldigdes 9 en 73.
Hulle is daarna by die hoofhek uit waar sommige  met =n bekertjie Ntelezi  uit
twee emmers wat daar gestaan het, geskep en gedrink het.   By die hek het
beskuldigde 9 gesê dat hulle in twee groepe moet verdeel wanneer hulle
Boipatong nader.  Die een groep moes na Boipatong en die ander groep na
Slovopark gaan.   Hy het hulle gewaarsku om nie hul eie mense te beseer nie
en om in stilte te beweeg.   Hierna is hulle oor die veld na Boipatong waar sy
groep in Moshoeshoestraat,  links op in Lekoastraat en regs in Bapedistraat
beweeg het.   Beskuldigde 9 was die leier van sy groep en het heel voor
geloop.     In Moshoeshoestraat  het Mnqithi gehoor dat met =n AK-47  vanuit
sy groep geskiet word.     Daarna het hulle begin om die vensters van huise
met klippe stukkend te gooi.   Ene Themba van hulle groep het twee skote

geskiet op =n  groep inwoners wat hulle teengekom het.   Hulle het by huise
ingegaan en goedere geroof.  By een huis het hy =n bierhouer vol musiekplate
geneem.  By =n ander huis het =n Sierra-voertuig gestaan en hy het met =n
hamer die vensters van die voertuig stukkend geslaan nadat een die
brandstoftenk van die voertuig probeer stukkend steek het.  By =n ander huis
het een van die inwoners uitgekom en Mnqithi het die indruk gekry dat hy in
sy maag gesteek was.   By =n sekere hoekhuis  het hulle =n brandende
buiteband in die huis gegooi.   Hulle het daarna die woonbuurt verlaat en is
terug na KwaMadala langs dieselfde roete as wat hulle gekom het.   Party
mense het goedere gedra wat hulle gebuit het.   Die volgende dag is hierdie
goed aan die brand gesteek nadat hulle gehoor het dat die polisie die plek sou
kom deursoek.
Mnqithi het getuig dat hy na die aanval op =n ander aanklag gearresteer
is.   Na sy vrylating het hy nie weer teruggekeer na KwaMadala nie.   Hy is

deur lede van die ANC gered van sekere persone wat sy lewe bedreig het en
hy het toe vir die organisasie vertel van sy betrokkenheid by die aanval.   Deur
bemiddeling van die ANC het hy sy getuienis aan die Staat aangebied en hy is
deur die ANC na die Verhoorhof gebring.
Daar is stawing vir gedeeltes van die medepligtiges se getuienis te vind
in die getuienis van Theresa Mofokeng.   Sy het getuig dat sy vanaf Maart
1992 in KwaMadala gewoon het.   Sy het aanvanklik =n kamer gedeel met
Bojosi, beskuldigde 70 en =n aantal ander persone.   Voor 17 Junie 1992 het sy
=n verhouding met beskuldigde 74 aangeknoop en sy het toe in sy kamer
ingetrek wat hy met onder andere beskuldigdes 60, 65, 68 en 73 gedeel het.
Die aand van 17 Junie 1992 het =n sirene =n vergadering van inwoners in die
stadion aangekondig.    By die stadion het  mense  die liedjie  An spies wat rooi
is@,  gesing.  Die vrouens is weggestuur voor die vergadering begin het en op
pad terug na haar kamer het sy Damara se voertuig voor die stadion sien staan

wat nie sy gewone plek was nie.   Later die aand het die mans wat in die
kamer woon ingekom om lappies vir hul koppe te kry.   Hulle het ook hul
kieries en assegaaie geneem en weer uitgegaan.   Op =n stadium daarna het sy
en haar kamermaat, ene Manosi, by die stadion gaan inloer om te sien wat
aangaan maar daar was toe niemand nie.   Die mans het later die aand
teruggekom met hul wapens en die lappies om hul koppe.   Daarna is sy na die
kamer van beskuldigde 64 om vir ene Busisiwe te sien.   Beskuldigdes 64, 65
en =n  paar ander mans was in die afgeskorte kombuisgedeelte van die kamer.
Sy het gehoor dat hulle onder mekaar praat dat hulle =n  Aonrus@  gemaak het
by Boipatong.  Sy is later terug na haar kamer en het gaan slaap.   Die
volgende oggend  het sy =n bloedbevlekte duvet op beskuldigde 60 se bed
gesien wat Manosi later gewas het.
Theresa Mofokeng het voorts getuig dat daar op 18 Junie 1992 weer =n
vergadering van inwoners gehou is waarop beskuldigde 73 opdrag gegee het

dat alle goed wat by Boipatong gebuit is, verbrand moet word voordat die
polisie die plek kom deursoek.   Daarna het sy gesien dat beskuldigde 74 met
=n TV-stel uit sy moeder se kamer kom.     Sy het nie gesien dat hy dit in die
vuur gooi nie.    Sy het ook gesien dat  beskuldigde 64  goed verband.
Daar is verdere sterk stawing vir die medepligtiges se getuienis dat die
aanvallers uit  KwaMadala gekom het, te vind in die getuienis van Albertus de
Jager, Salmon Roberts, Hendrik Cloete en Jakob Botha.    De Jager het getuig
dat hy by Cape Gate in Nobel Boulevard werk en ongeveer vyf tot ses minute
per motor daarvandaan woon.     Om ongeveer vyf-en-twintig voor tien die
aand van 17 Junie 1992 was hy in sy motor van suid na noord in Frikkie
Meyer Boulevard op pad vanaf sy huis na Cape Gate waar sy nagskof om
tienuur sou begin.    Hy het =n groep van ongeveer 150 mense vanuit die
rigting van KwaMadala in die rigting van Boipatong die pad voor hom sien
kruis.    Hy het omgedraai en is terug huis toe van waar  hy die polisie en die

onluste-eenheid in Vereniging gebel het.  Toe hy verneem  dat die polisie
bewus is van die gebeure het hy weer na Cape Gate vertrek en kort voor
tienuur daar aangekom.    Toe hy by die ingang van Cape Gate kom, het hy =n
groep mense vanaf  Boipatong na Cape Gate sien hardloop en hy het =n tweede
keer teruggekeer na sy huis.    Hy het weer die onluste-eenheid gebel en is toe
aangesê om  oor =n halfuur weer werk toe te gaan.  Ongeveer halfelf die aand
het hy weer vertrek en in die omgewing van KwaMadala het hy =n groep
mense so groot as die eerste  keer vanaf  Boipatong in die rigting van
KwaMadala  Frikkie Meyer Boulevard sien kruis.   Hy het weer omgedraai en
is huis toe.
Cloete en Roberts was lede van =n weermag-eenheid van vyf persone
wat die betrokke aand in =n onluste-voertuig op =n roetine  patrollie in die
omgewing was.   Kort na tienuur die aand het hulle in Nobel Boulevard voor

Cape Gate gestop en  geweerskote vanuit Boipatong gehoor.    Hulle het  te
voet in Nobel Boulevard al langs die grens van Boipatong beweeg en Cloete
het getuig dat hy mense in die woonbuurt sien beweeg en gille gehoor het. =n
Man het by hulle gekom en gesê dat hulle hom moet help aangesien sy vrou en
kind doodgemaak is.    Hulle het versterkings aangevra en Cloete het by een
van die twee Buffel-voertuie wat opgedaag het, ingeklim.      Die voertuig het
suid in Frikkie Meyer Boulevard gery en Cloete het =n groot groep mense uit
Boipatong sien  kom wat  in die veld in twee groepe verdeel en besig was om
in die rigting van Frikkie Meyer Boulevard te beweeg.       Die Buffel het
gestop en beide groepe is ongeveer vyftig meter voor die Buffel oor Frikkie
Meyer Boulevard in die rigting van KwaMadala.  Cloete het getuig dat die
groep gewapen was met spiese en stokke en dat een =n wapen wat soos =n AK-
47 gelyk het, gedra het.     Hulle het  wit kopdoeke op gehad.       Die Buffel
het omgedraai en tot by KwaMadala gery waar hulle die ander Buffel sowel as

die eenheid se onluste-voertuig en die polisie se Casspir-voertuie by die
parkeerarea voor die ingang van KwaMadala aangetref het.
Botha was lid van =n ander weermag-eenheid wat die betrokke aand
busse met werkers vanaf Iscor  na KwaMazisa,  wat ongeveer vyftien
kilometer vanaf KwaMadala geleë is, in =n Buffel  begelei  het.      Om kwart-
oor-tien het sy eenheid =n berig ontvang en die Buffel is na  Frikkie Meyer
Boulevard vanwaar hulle =n groep van ongeveer 500 mense in die veld tussen
die pad en Boipatong gewaar het.     Die groep het Frikkie Meyer Boulevard
oorgesteek in die rigting van KwaMadala.     Die Buffel het gestop en die
seksie-leier het uitgeklim en aankomende verkeer gestop terwyl die groep
mense oor die pad beweeg het.   Die Buffel is daarvandaan na KwaMadala
waar hulle omstreeks kwart-voor-elf aangekom het en waar hulle
bevelvoerder, majoor Jordaan, by hulle aangesluit het.     Kort na hul aankoms
by KwaMadala het twee polisie-voertuie daar aangekom en ook twee

weermag-voertuie.
Oor die gebeure in Boipatong self is daar stawing vir die medepligtiges
se getuienis in die getuienis van polisie-sersant Schlebusch en dié van
inwoners van Boipatong.    Volgens Schlebusch is =n berig om ongeveer kwart
voor tien die aand van 17 Junie 1992 ontvang dat Boipatong deur =n groep
mense aangeval word.     Schlebusch is in =n Casspir-voertuig na Boipatong
waar hy in Hlubistraat gesien het dat huise se vensters gebreek is.  Voor huis
961 op die hoek van Lekoa- en Hlubistrate het Abednego Mabuza die  polisie
gestop en hulp gevra.       Schlebusch is saam met hom sy huis binne.   In die
ingang het =n vrou met verskeie kap- en steekwonde gelê.    Sy was reeds
dood.  In die kamer het nog =n beseerde vrou op die bed gelê en kreun.    Die
deure en vensters was gebreek en binne was alles deurmekaar en omgekeer.
Schlebusch het dadelik sy beheerstasie per radio in kennis gestel en versoek
dat =n ambulans sowel as ander eenhede van die polisie na die toneel gestuur

word.    Volgens Schlebusch was dit halfelf die aand toe hy by die huis
aangekom het.  Vanaf huis 761 is Schlebusch na huis 765 in Hlubistraat waar
hy nog twee lyke en =n beseerde vrou met kap-,  steek- en skietwonde
aangetref het.    In die straat voor hierdie huis het =n groep gewapende
jeugdiges  saamgedrom en geskreeu dat hulle KwaMadala gaan aanval.
Schlebusch en sersant Kruger, wat intussen om tien voor elf in sy Njala-
voertuig by hom aangesluit het, het per radio opdrag gekry om die veld tussen
Boipatong en KwaMadala te patrolleer en te verhoed dat mense van die een
gebied na die ander beweeg.   Voordat hulle die gebied by huis 765 verlaat
het, het die ambulans en ander polisie-eenhede ook daar aangekom.
Schlebusch en Kruger het hierna in die veld wes van Boipatong gaan wag en
is later saam met weermagversterkings terug na Boipatong waar hulle die res
van die nag behulpsaam was met die polisieondersoek.
Meer as =n honderd inwoners van Boipatong het by die verhoor oor die

aanval getuig.   In sowel breë trekke as in fyner detail steun hulle die
weergawes van die medepligtiges oor die aanval.    Baie inwoners het getuig
dat die aanvallers wit lappies om hul koppe gehad het en dat hulle Zoeloe-
sprekend was.   Bojosi en Moloi se getuienis oor die beskadiging van =n
Peugeot in Tugelastraat word gestaaf deur die getuienis van Aaron Pesa voor
wie se huis die voertuig gestaan het en wat die beskadiging gesien het.   Bojosi
se getuienis dat =n Sierra-voertuig by Hlubistraat 773 geplunder is en Mnqithi
se getuienis dat hy die ruite van =n Sierra-voertuig met =n hamer stukkend
geslaan het nadat een probeer het om die brandstoftenk stukkend te steek,
welke getuienis klaarblyklik na dieselfde voertuig verwys,  is bevestig deur
Rachel Mbhele wat by daardie adres woon en oor die skade aan die voertuig
getuig het.
Moloi se getuienis oor die drie moorde by een huis word in belangrike
opsigte gestaaf deur Alice Nonjoli, die moeder van een van die kinders.

Volgens Nonjoli was sy in die hangkas en die twee oorlede kinders onder die
bed in =n kamer by hul  huis te Hlubistraat 765 toe drie aanvallers die kamer
binnegekom het.  Die een kind is doodgesteek met =n spies en die ander is
doodgeskiet met =n  handwapen.   Nonjoli het later haar skoonmoeder in =n
ander kamer dood aangetref.    Nonjoli het bevestig dat =n kinderfiets uit die
huis gesteel is.   Moloi se getuienis dat beskuldigde 67 die een oorledene met
=n 9 mm pistool doodgeskiet het, is verder gestaaf deur die getuienis van
Patrick Nonjoli en luitenant Dirk Cornelius van der Merwe ten effekte dat vyf
9 mm patroondoppies in die betrokke huis gevind is.
Moloi se getuienis oor die plundering by Lekoastraat 761 word
wesenlik gestaaf deur Samuel Mashope en sy getuienis oor die brand by die
huis op die hoek van Hlubi- en Bafokengstrate word gestaaf deur die getuienis
van Dinah Manyika en Ernest Mtimkulu.
Mnqithi se getuienis dat hy by =n huis ingegaan het en =n bierhouer met

musiekplate daarin gesteel het, word bevestig deur Mary Baloyi van wie die
plate gesteel is.   Sy getuienis dat hulle =n brandende buiteband by =n sekere
hoekhuis ingegooi het, word gestaaf deur Ernest Mthimkulu en Dinah
Manyika.   Laasgenoemde het getuig dat sy by haar ouers op die hoek van
Hlubi- en Bafokengstrate woon en dat sy gesien het dat =n brandende
buiteband deur die venster by die huis ingegooi word.
Soos die Verhoorhof in sy uitspraak op die meriete  daarop wys, is daar
vele punte van ooreenkoms tussen die getuienis van die drie medepligtiges,
nie net in die breë trekke daarvan nie maar ook wat die fyner detail betref.   So
meld al drie die vergadering vooraf, dieselfde roete wat gevolg is, die skietery
by die kruising van Moshoeshoe- en Lekoastrate, die teen- woordigheid van
weermagvoertuie, dat beskuldigde 67 per ongeluk deur een van sy makkers
beseer is en dat  die gesteelde goed die volgende dag verbrand is.   Beide
Bojosi en Mnqithi noem verder die musiekplate wat laasgenoemde gesteel het

en die beskadiging van die Sierra-voertuig.   Bojosi en Moloi noem beide die
plundering van die Peugeot-voertuig.
Soos ek reeds gemeld het, is daar verder sterk stawing vir die
medepligtiges se getuienis in dié van Theresa Mofokeng.    Sy bevestig dat =n
vergadering van inwoners die aand van 17 Junie 1992 gehou is,  dat
gewapende inwoners met wit lappies om hul koppe  op =n ekspedisie vertrek
het en dat goedere wat hulle daar aangebring het,  die volgende dag verbrand
is.   Haar getuienis is deur die Verhoorhof as betroubaar aanvaar en geen
voldoende rede is aangevoer om met hierdie bevinding in te meng nie.
Die Verhoorhof het bevind dat Bojosi en Moloi, ten spyte van gebreke
en foute in hul getuienis, eerlike en betroubare getuies was.  Van Mnqithi het
die Verhoorhof gesê dat, alhoewel daar in verskeie opsigte objektiewe stawing
vir sy getuienis is, hy nie altyd =n betroubare getuie was nie.  Die Verhoorhof
was egter nie bereid om sy getuienis in die geheel te verwerp nie.

Wat die algemene strekking van die medepligtiges se getuienis betref,
is daar afdoende stawing deur onbetwisbare getuienis dat die aanvallers uit
KwaMadala gekom het.   Daar is verder afdoende stawing vir hul getuienis dat
die aanval vooraf beplan en georganiseerd was en dat die aanvallers in =n
groep en tot die tande gewapen saam uit KwaMadala na Boipatong opgeruk
het.   Die moontlikheid, soos betoog, dat die aanvallers spontaan en  verspreid
uit alle rigtings Boipatong binnegeval het nadat hulle een vir een deur die
omheining agter die geboue in KwaMadala geglip het, is totaal strydig met die
getuienis van De Jager en die weermaglede waarna ek reeds verwys het.   Soos
ek ook reeds gemeld het, is daar in talle opsigte stawing uit die mond van
inwoners van Boipatong vir die medepligtiges se weergawe van die gebeure in
Boipatong.
By die verhoor is namens die beskuldigdes aangevoer dat die polisie
betrokke was by die aanval op Boipatong.   Die Verhoorhof het bevind dat

daar geen polisiebetrokkenheid by die aanval was nie en hierdie bevinding is
nie voor ons aangeveg nie.
Namens die beskuldigdes is egter betoog dat daar =n sameswering tussen
Bojosi en Moloi was, met of sonder beïnvloeding deur die polisie, om vals te
getuig.   Ter ondersteuning van hierdie betoog is genoem dat hulle op
dieselfde dag gearresteer is en daarna gelyktydig besluit het om vir die Staat te
getuig.   Die betoog berus op blote spekulasie.   Daar is geen aanduiding dat
hulle met mekaar in verbinding was tydens hul aanhouding nie.   Indien daar
=n sameswering was,  sou ek ook =n groter mate van ooreenstemming tussen
hul getuienis verwag het.
Namens die beskuldigdes is veel gewag gemaak van verskille en
weersprekings tussen die getuienis van die medepligtiges.   Ek vind dit nie
nodig om enige daarvan in besonderhede te behandel nie.  Dit is almal van
nie-wesenlike aard en is te verwagte en doen nie afbreuk aan die

geloofwaardigheidsbevindings van die Verhoorhof nie.
Wat die inhoud van die voorafgaande afspraak betref, is namens die
beskuldigdes betoog dat dit slegs was om die sogenaamde comrades aan te val
en nie Boipatong as geheel nie.   Daar is geen feitebasis vir hierdie betoog nie.
Dit is natuurlik so dat die aanvallers wraak wou neem vir optrede deur die
comrades.   Alle aanduidings is egter dat die afspraak was om Boipatong en
nie slegs die comrades nie, aan te val.  Al drie die medepligtiges het getuig ten
effekte dat besluit is om Boipatong aan te val.   Die wyse waarop die aanval
uitgevoer is, staaf hierdie getuienis. Na my mening is daar voldoende bewys
van =n voorafbestaande ooreenkoms om die misdade te pleeg.   In die
omstandighede van hierdie saak is die afleiding onafwendbaar dat elkeen wat
deel gehad het aan die afspraak,  gehandel het met óf die direkte opset om die
misdade te pleeg óf die risiko van die pleging daarvan voorsien en onverskillig
daarteenoor gestaan het.

Die kernvraag bly natuurlik of daar stawing is vir die medepligtiges se
getuienis ten opsigte van elke individuele beskuldigde.    Sodanige stawing
kan in die getuienis van =n ander medepligtige gevind word mits hy =n
betroubare getuie is (S v Hlapezula and Others   1965(4) SA 439 (A) op 441
A-C.)
In hierdie verband moet die vraag oorweeg word of die medepligtiges
moontlike motiewe gehad het om onskuldige persone,  en in besonder hierdie
beskuldigdes valslik te impliseer (cf  R v Ncanana  1948(4) SA 399 (A) op
405).     In die omstandighede van hierdie saak is ek tevrede dat daar geen
algemene sodanige motief was nie.  Die medepligtiges het hul eie deelname
erken en daar was geen rede  om wat hulle self gedoen het op ander af te skuif
nie.
Dit is vervolgens nodig om die getuienis teen elke beskuldigde
afsonderlik te oorweeg.   Die beskuldigdes het almal getuig en sommige het

ander getuies geroep om namens hulle te getuig.
Beskuldigde 2
Volgens Bojosi was beskuldigde 2 een van die gesamentlike voorsitters
van die beheerkomitee by KwaMadala asook die leier van die jeug.   Dit is
ondenkbaar dat hy nie deel gehad het aan die voorafgaande afspraak om
Boipatong aan te val nie.    Volgens Bojosi was hy die betrokke  aand met =n
AK-47 gewapen en was hy een van dié wat  voor geloop het op pad na
Boipatong.      Moloi het ook getuig dat beskuldigde 2 die jeugleier was en die
aand =n AK-47 gehad het en aan die aanval deelgeneem het.    Mnqithi het ook
vir beskuldigde 2 in besit van =n AK-47 gesien by die vergadering die
betrokke aand.
Beskuldigde 2 het getuig dat hy =n lid van Inkatha was, dat hy voorheen
in =n  hostel in Sebokeng gewoon het maar dat hy in 1990 as gevolg van =n
twis tussen die ANC en Inkatha uit die hostel gedryf is en in KwaMadala gaan

woon het.  Hy het die betrokke aand kort na agtuur gaan slaap en weet niks
van enige vergadering wat daardie aand gehou is of van enige aanval op
Boipatong nie.   Hy was die aand alleen in sy kamer en het niks gehoor nie.
Beskuldigde 2 het erken dat hy die jeugleier in KwaMadala was en het
aanvanklik erken dat hy as sodanig sitting op die beheerkomitee gehad het
maar het dit later ontken.    Beskuldigde 2 het getuig dat die sirene vir die hou
van =n vergadering nie die betrokke aand gelui het nie want as dit gelui het sou
hy dit gehoor het.   Die volgende dag was  hy om vieruur die middag terug by
KwaMadala nadat hy gaan inkopies doen het in die dorp en daar is geen
vergaderings die res van die dag gehou nie.   Hy weet niks van goed wat
verbrand is nie.   Mense word met Ntelezi besprinkel om hulle te kalmeer
wanneer hulle kwaad is.   Hy weet van geen vuurwapens wat in KwaMadala
was nie.    Die enigste rede waarom mense bandjies om hulle kop vasbind,  is
om hulle mooi te laat lyk.

Die Verhoorhof het beskuldigde 2 se getuienis as vals verwerp.   Soos
die Verhoorhof tereg daarop wys, kom sy getuienis neer op =n ontkenning dat
Boipatong hoegenaamd die betrokke aand deur inwoners van KwaMadala
aangeval was,   terwyl die onbetwiste getuienis oorweldigend daarop dui dat
dit wel die geval was.    As een van die leiersfigure in KwaMadala, maar selfs
as =n  gewone inwoner, is dit ondenkbaar dat die aanval uit KwaMadala
geloods was  sonder dat hy daarvan bewus was.   Sy getuienis is dus tereg as
vals verwerp.   Sy verduideliking van die gebruik van Ntelezi is deur die
Verhoorhof as onwaarskynlik beskryf in die lig van die onbetwiste getuienis
van kolonel Davidson dat Ntelezi volgens Zoeloe-gewoontes aangewend word
om mense te beskerm teen gevaar of beserings in =n geveg-situasie.   Na my
mening is die afleiding uit die omstandigheidsgetuienis onafwendbaar dat
beskuldigde 2 deelgeneem het aan =n voorafgaande afspraak om Boipatong
aan te val en is hy korrek skuldig bevind.

Beskuldigde 9
Volgens al drie die medepligtiges het beskuldigde 9 =n leiersrol gespeel
in die aanval.   Volgens hulle was hy =n indoena of leier, was dit hy wat by die
vergadering die betrokke aand gesê het dat Boipatong aangeval moet word en
dat die mense hulle moet bewapen.   Volgens al drie medepligtiges het
beskuldigde 9 gehelp om Ntelezi uit te deel en het hy self =n vuurwapen gedra.
Volgens Moloi en Mnqithi was beskuldigde 9 een van dié wat voor geloop
het op pad na Boipatong en was dit hy wat teruggeskiet het toe daar deur
mense van Boipatong op hulle gevuur is.
Beskuldigde 9 het in sy getuienis gesê dat hy =n lid van Inkatha is en dat
hy op =n soortgelyke wyse as beskuldigde 2 in KwaMadala beland het.   Hy
het erken dat hy =n indoena en tradisionele leier van die Zoeloes is.   Hy het
die betrokke aand tussen nege-uur en tienuur gaan slaap en weet niks van die
aanval nie.   Hy weet van geen vergadering of die uitbrand van goedere die

volgende dag nie.   Alhoewel hy in =n borgaansoek beweer het dat hy =n lid
van die beheerkomitee was en Bojosi ook so getuig het, het beskuldigde 9
ontken dat hy =n lid van die komitee was of dat hy ooit so aan sy
regsverteenwoordigers gesê het vir doeleindes van die borgaansoek.    Soos in
die geval van beskuldigde 2 kom sy getuienis ook daarop neer dat hy ontken
dat die aanval vanuit KwaMadala geloods is.    Dit is strydig met die
onbetwisbare  getuienis en die waarskynlikhede en sy getuienis is korrek deur
die Verhoorhof verwerp as nie redelik moontlik waar nie.   Hy is korrek
skuldig bevind op dieselfde basis as beskuldigde 2.
Beskuldigde 14
Beide Bojosi en Moloi het getuig dat beskuldigde 14 aan die aanval
deelgeneem het.   Volgens Bojosi was beskuldigde 14 een van dié wat by
Zondo se  taverne in Boipatong ingegaan het en het hy =n groot sak gedra toe

hulle Boipatong verlaat.    Moloi het getuig dat beskuldigde 14 =n TV-stel in
Boipatong gesteel het.     Moloi het die volgende dag die polisie gekeer  toe
hulle op die gesteelde goedere in beskuldigde 14 se kamer wou beslag lê.

Beskuldigde 14 het getuig dat hy na KwaMadala gevlug het, dat hy die
betrokke aand vroeg gaan slaap het in sy kamer in KwaMadala en dat hy van
niks weet nie.    Soos in die geval van beskuldigdes 2 en 9 kom sy getuienis
daarop neer dat daar nie =n aanval vanuit KwaMadala was nie en vir dieselfde
redes as in hulle geval is sy getuienis tereg deur die Verhoorhof verwerp.
Selfs al het hy nie deel gehad aan die voorafgaande ooreenkoms om
Boipatong aan te val nie, het hy aan die aanval deelgeneem met die
klaarblyklike opset om gemeensaak te maak met die ander wat die misdade
gepleeg het, terwyl hy die moontlikheid voorsien het dat die ander die misdade
kon pleeg in die bereiking van hulle gemeenskaplike doel en hy onverskillig
was daaromtrent.  Sy optrede voldoen aan die vyf voorvereistes vir

aanspreeklikheid op die basis van gemeenskaplike doel wat hierdie Hof in S v
Mgedezi 1989(1) SA 687(A) op 705 I - 706 C gestel het.  Hy is korrek skuldig
bevind.
Beskuldigde 31
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 31 by die vergadering gehelp het om
Ntelezi te sprinkel en dat hy toe met =n kierie en =n spies gewapen was.
Volgens Moloi het beskuldigde 31 in die veld op pad na Boipatong vir die
groep gesê dat hulle vir die ander moes wag.   Hy het getuig dat beskuldigde
31 met  =n assegaai deelgeneem het aan die aanval.    Beskuldigde 31 het
verder die dag daarna gehelp om die goed wat verbrand moes word, bymekaar
te maak.
Beskuldigde 31 het getuig dat hy =n Zoeloe en =n Inkatha-ondersteuner
is en dat hy  vanaf  KwaMazisa verdryf is na KwaMadala.  Hy het erken dat
hy in =n gesagsposisie in die hostel was.   Die betrokke aand het hy om agtuur

gaan slaap en weet van niks.  Indien die alarm afgegaan het, sou hy dit gehoor
het.   Verder weet hy niks daarvan dat goed die volgende dag uitgebrand is
nie.
Die Hof a quo wys in sy uitspraak op sekere onbevredigende aspekte in
beskuldigde 31 se getuienis.   So byvoorbeeld is hy gevra om =n koerantberig
te bevestig waarvolgens hy as die segsman van KwaMadala se inwoners  aan
=n joernalis sou gesê het dat hulle (die Zoeloes) sou veg indien hulle aangeval
word.   Hy het die vraag ontwyk en was nie bereid om te sê wat hy aan die
koerant gesê het nie.   Hy het verder  getuig dat hy Boipatong goed ken omdat
sy broers daar verhoudings aangeknoop het.   Later het dit geblyk dat hy self
voorheen daar gewoon het.   Beskuldigde 31 het erken dat toe die sirene  die
dag na die gebeure afgaan,  hy dadelik sy wapen gegryp het en saam met die
ander tot by die kruising van Frikkie Meyer Boulevard en Nobel Boulevard
gegaan het omdat  =n weerwraak-aanval deur inwoners van Boipatong verwag

was.   Hy het ook gesê dat Ntelezi gebruik word indien mense kwaad word.
Sy algehele ontkenning van enige kennis van of deelname aan die aanval is
deur die Hof a quo as vals verwerp.     Na my mening is bo redelike twyfel
bewys dat hy deel gehad het aan die voorafgaande afspraak om Boipatong aan
te val en dat hy deelgeneem het aan die aanval.      Hy is korrek skuldig
bevind.
Beskuldigde 36
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 36 die dag na die aanval en tydens =n
gesprek oor die gebeure, gespog het dat hy =n persoon gesteek het.   Volgens
Moloi het beskuldigde 36, gewapen met =n assegaai, saam met hom by =n
sekere perseel in Boipatong ingegaan.    Die dag na die moorde het
beskuldigde 36 gespog dat Asy assegaai het iemand opgeëet@.    Die
Verhoorhof het by die beoordeling van Moloi se getuienis teen beskuldigde 36
in ag geneem dat hy moontlik =n motief kon hê om beskuldigde 36 valslik te

impliseer omdat, volgens Moloi, beskuldigde 36 vantevore sy dogtertjie
verkrag het.
Beskuldigde 36 het getuig dat hy =n Zoeloe is en dat hy gedurende 1991
vanuit Evaton waar sy ouerhuis afgebrand is deur die ANC, na KwaMadala
gevlug het.   Op 17 Junie 1992 was hy so siek dat hy slegs opgestaan het om
toilet toe te gaan.   Hy het die aand vroeg gaan slaap en weet van niks.  Indien
die sirene gelui het, sou hy dit gehoor het.    Die volgende oggend het hy egter
saam met die groep uitgegaan  om die verwagte aanval vanaf Boipatong te
ontmoet.     Beskuldigde 36 se getuienis is onoortuigend en is tereg deur die
Verhoorhof verwerp.   Hy is op die basis van gemeenskaplike doel  tereg
skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde 55
Van die medepligtiges het slegs Moloi gesê dat beskuldigde 55 aan die
aanval  deelgeneem het en wel met =n assegaai.   Een van die inwoners van

Boipatong, Richard Msibi,  het egter vir beskuldigde 55 uitgeken as een van
die aanvallers wat in sy huis ingekom en  hom met =n spies gesteek het.   Hy
het beskuldigde 55 aan =n merk tussen sy oë uitgeken in =n foto-album van die
polisie waarin daar honderde foto=s was.
Beskuldigde 55 het getuig dat hy gedurende 1991 vanuit Sebokeng na
KwaMadala gevlug het.   Hy het die betrokke aand gaan slaap en dra geen
kennis van die aanval nie.
Die Verhoorhof het beskuldigde 55 se alibi verwerp en sy uitkenning
deur Msibi as betroubaar aanvaar.    Daar bestaan geen rede om met hierdie
bevinding in te meng nie en beskuldigde 55 is op die basis van
gemeenskaplike doel tereg skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde  58
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 58 die sekretaris van die
beheerkomitee was.   Sy getuienis oor beskuldigde 58 se deelname aan die

aanval was egter nie oortuigend nie.   Hy getuig eers dat beskuldigde 58 by die
stadion gewapen was met =n assegaai en =n kierie maar later sê hy dat hy nie
kan onthou hoe beskuldigde 58 gewapen was nie.    Sy getuienis is verder dat
hy nie vir beskuldigde 58 in Boipatong gesien het nie.  Verder getuig  Bojosi
eers dat beskuldigde 58 die opdrag gegee het om die geroofde goed te
verbrand maar later sê hy dat die opdrag van ene Khumalo gekom het.   Moloi
se getuienis was dat beskuldigde 58 hulle kom roep het om na die vergadering
te gaan, dat hy by die stadion die inwoners aangesê het om wit lappies om
hulle koppe te bind en dat hy gehelp het om die inwoners met Ntelezi te
besprinkel.  Hy getuig ook dat beskuldigde 58 by die stadion een van die AK-
47=s geneem en vir hom gesê het dat omdat hy Afrikaans kan praat hy aan die
polisie moes sê,  indien hulle voorgekeer word, dat die comrades hulle
aangeval het en dat hulle besig was om die comrades te verdryf.
Beskuldigde 58 se getuienis was dat hy uit Sebokeng verdryf is na

KwaMadala.   Die betrokke aand het hy om halfagt gaan slaap en hy weet van
niks.   Volgens sy eie getuienis is dit duidelik dat hy een van die leiers in
KwaMadala was.   Dit was sy taak om van elke inwoner R10 in te samel
wanneer iemand gesterf het,  om die geld te bestee en daarna by =n vergadering
van inwoners verslag te doen.  Dit was verder sy funksie om vir beskuldigde 2
te help om vergaderings van die jeug byeen te roep.
Beskuldigde 58 het  getuig dat die polisie na sy arrestasie aan hom gesê
het dat,  indien hy hulle sou help,  hulle vir hom =n huis in Kaapstad sou bou
en hom R250,000 betaal.     By sy huis sou die polisie hom oppas soos hulle
met die Staatspresident doen.     Beskuldigde 58 was =n opsigtelike leuenaar en
sy getuienis is tereg deur die Verhoorhof verwerp.     Moloi se getuienis oor sy
rol by die voorafgaande vergadering was indrukwekkend en oortuigend en
word deur beskuldigde 58 se leuenagtigheid en tot =n mate deur Bojosi gestaaf.
Daarvolgens was hy een van dié wat vooraf afgespreek het om Boipatong

aan te val en gehelp het om die aanval te organiseer.   Hy was self gewapen
met =n AK-47 en die afleiding is onvermydelik dat hy saam na Boipatong toe
is en aan die aanval deelgeneem het.    Hy is korrek skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde 59
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 59 in Boipatong met =n haelgeweer
met die merk  A4 x 4@  op die kolf op =n persoon gevuur het.     Moloi het
bevestig dat beskuldigde 59 die betrokke aand met =n haelgeweer gewapen
was.     Volgens Moloi het beskuldigde 59 die volgende dag aan hulle gesê dat
hy =n kind met die geweer geskiet het.   =n Haelgeweer,  soortgelyk aan die een
wat Bojosi beskryf het,  is by die Verhoorhof as bewysstuk ingehandig.
Volgens beskuldigde 59 was hy teenwoordig toe die polisie hierdie
haelgeweer in KwaMadala gekry het.   Hy het egter ontken dat hy enigsins
bewus was van hierdie of ander versteekte wapens.  Gedurende die
kruisverhoor van Bojosi was dit egter namens beskuldigde 59 gestel dat hy

gesien het toe die geweer begrawe is.    Beskuldigde 59 kon hierdie aspek nie
in sy getuienis verduidelik nie.
In die lig van die getuienis van Bojosi en Moloi en beskuldigde 59 se
onvermoë om sy verbintenis met die haelgeweer te verduidelik, het die
Verhoorhof tereg sy ontkenning van sy deelname aan die aanval verwerp.
Hy is korrek skuldig bevind op die grondslag van gemeenskaplike doel.
Beskuldigde 60
Hierdie beskuldigde word deur die getuienis van Bojosi, Moloi en
Theresa Mofokeng met die pleging van die misdade verbind.   Volgens Bojosi
het hy vir beskuldigde 60 met =n  Z 88-handwapen in Boipatong gesien
deelneem aan die aanval.    Volgens Moloi het hy vir beskuldigde 60 by die
stadion  in besit van =n kierie gesien.       Theresa Mofokeng se getuienis was
dat beskuldigde 60 op die betrokke aand na die stadion gegaan het nadat die
sirene gelui het en dat hy later na die kamer teruggekeer het om =n wapen en =n

lappie vir sy kop te kry.   Hy het later met =n bebloede duvet teruggekeer wat
die volgende dag gewas is.
Beskuldigde 60 het getuig dat hy pas vantevore in Sebokeng in =n geveg
met die comrades betrokke was en dat hy in die rug, kop, been en voorarm
geskiet is.  Hy het daarna na KwaMadala gevlug waar hy in dieselfde kamer as
beskuldigde 74 was.    Hy weet niks van die aanval nie en sou weens sy
beserings in elk geval nie daaraan kon deelneem nie.    Theresa Mofokeng se
getuienis dat sy op 17 Junie 1992 in dieselfde kamer as beskuldigdes 60 en 74
gewoon het, is nooit betwis nie.  In sy getuienis het beskuldigde 60 egter
ontken dat Theresa saam met hom in =n kamer gebly het op daardie stadium.
Sy getuie,  Augustina Tsotetsi,  weerspreek sy getuienis in hierdie verband
waar sy beweer dat Theresa op daardie stadium wel daar geslaap maar nooit
daar ingetrek het nie.    Die Verhoorhof het Augustina Tsotetsi se getuienis
verwerp as bevooroordeeld en onwaarskynlik en Theresa se getuienis aanvaar.

Beskuldigde 60 se weergawe is na my mening deur die Verhoorhof verwerp.
Hy is tereg skuldig bevind op die grondslag van gesamentlike doel.
Beskuldigde  62
Volgens beide Bojosi en Moloi het beskuldigde 62, gewapen met =n
spies,  aan die aanval deelgeneem.   Volgens eersgenoemde het hy in
Tugelastraat  die bande van =n Peugeot met die spies stukkend gesteek.
Beskuldigde 62 het getuig dat hy gedurende Januarie 1992 uit Sebokeng
na KwaMadala gevlug het en dat hy niks van die gebeure weet nie.  As daar
wel =n aanval uit KwaMadala was,  sou hy daarvan geweet het.     Sy getuienis
is tereg as vals verwerp.       Sy deelname aan die aanval het met
gemeenskaplike doel geskied en hy is tereg skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde 64
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 64 deelgeneem het aan die aanval en
in besonder dat hy by die huis op die hoek van Hlubi- en Lekoastrate

ingegaan het.     Moloi het getuig dat beskuldigde 64 met =n pistool gewapen
was voordat hulle KwaMadala verlaat het en dat hy  Boipatong met gesteelde
goed verlaat het.  Hy het ook die volgende dag die gesteelde goed help
verbrand.  Theresa Mofokeng impliseer ook beskuldigde 64 in die sin dat hy
na die tyd erken het dat hy deelgeneem het aan die aanval.
Beskuldigde 64 het getuig dat hy sedert 1991 in KwaMadala woon.
Vroeg in  Junie 1992 is hy in die been deur die comrades geskiet en hy is eers
twee weke voor die betrokke dag uit die hospitaal ontslaan.    Hy kon toe slegs
met die hulp van krukke beweeg.    In kruisondervraging het hy toegegee dat
hy eers gedurende Augustus 1992 geskiet is en dat hy op 17 Junie 1992 niks
makeer het nie. Onbewus van hierdie toegewing het Busisiwe Mguli, wat
direk na beskuldigde 64 namens hom getuig het, ook gesê dat sy beskuldigde
64 op 17 Junie 1992 met krukke sien loop het.   Dit is duidelik dat dié getuie
en beskuldigde 64 vooraf saamgespan het om =n valse weergawe aan die hof

voor te lê, soos die Verhoorhof ook  bevind het.    Die Verhoorhof het tereg
bevind dat beskuldigde 64 met =n gemeenskaplike doel deelgeneem het aan die
aanval en hy is korrek skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde 65
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 65 deelgeneem het aan die aanval
terwyl hy met =n 7,65 mm pistool gewapen was, in  besonder dat hy een van
dié was wat die huis op die hoek van Lekoa- en Hlubistrate binnegegaan het.
Moloi het getuig dat beskuldigde 65 met =n kierie gewapen was, dat hy in =n
groep was wat vensters gebreek het, dat hy saam met ander goedere  by =n huis
uitgedra het en dat hy die volgende dag gesê het dat hy iemand verkrag het in
Boipatong.   Theresa Mofokeng het getuig dat beskuldigde 65 deel was van
die groepie wat gepraat het oor die Aonrus@  wat hulle in Boipatong gemaak
het.
Beskuldigde 65 het getuig dat hy eers op 27 Junie 1992  by KwaMadala

ingetrek het en dat hy niks van die gebeure af weet nie.  Volgens =n video wat
die polisie op 18 Junie 1992 by KwaMadala geneem het en wat aan
beskuldigde 65 in die hof getoon is, blyk dit dat hy reeds op daardie datum by
KwaMadala was.     Sy ontkenning dat hy op die video verskyn is deur die
Verhoorhof as leuenagtig bevind.   Daar bestaan geen rede om met die
Verhoorhof se verwerping van sy getuienis in te meng nie.    Hy is tereg op die
basis van gemeenskaplike doel skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde  68
Beide Bojosi en Moloi impliseer beskuldigde 68 by die aanval op
Boipatong.  Bojosi het getuig dat hy by die vergadering die betrokke aand  vir
beskuldigde 68 gevra het om beskuldigde 70 se AK-47 af te neem omdat
laasgenoemde gedreig het om =n inwoner te skiet.   Moloi het getuig dat hy vir
beskuldigde 68  gesien deelneem  het aan die aanval met  =n 9 mm pistool in
die hand.

Beskuldigde 68 het erken dat hy twee pistole besit  wat gelisensieer is.
Hy het getuig dat hy een van die persone is wat vanaf  KwaMazisa verdryf is
na  KwaMadala.    Die betrokke aand het hy omstreeks negeuur gaan slaap en
dra geen kennis van die gebeure nie.       Sy ontkenning dat hy aan die aanval
deelgeneem het,  is tereg deur die Verhoorhof verwerp.  Hy is op die
grondslag van gemeenskaplike doel skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde 70
Beide Bojosi en Moloi  het getuig dat beskuldigde 70, gewapen met =n
AK-47,  aan die aanval deelgeneem het.
Beskuldigde 70 het getuig dat hy gedurende 1991 deur die comrades uit
Sebokeng verdryf is en dat hy daarna by KwaMadala gaan woon het.    Vanaf
6 Junie tot 19 Junie 1992 was hy in Vereeniging in =n hofsaak betrokke.   Hy
het gedurende hierdie tyd by ene Ethel Mamato tuisgegaan en was op geen
stadium  by KwaMadala nie.      Ethel Mamato is nie  as =n getuie geroep nie.

Beskuldigde 70 verskyn op die video wat die polisie op 18 Junie 1992 by
KwaMadala geneem het. Beskuldigde 70 se getuienis is tereg deur die
Verhoorhof verwerp.   Hy is korrek skuldig bevind op die basis van
gemeenskaplike doel.
Beskuldigde  71
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 71 die dag na die aanval gehelp het
met die insameling en verbranding van die gesteelde goedere.     Moloi het
getuig dat beskuldigde 71 twee persone met =n assegaai doodgesteek het by die
huis in Hlubistraat.     Moloi se getuienis oor die moorde by hierdie huis is,
soos reeds daarop gewys, in belangrike opsigte deur die moeder van die een
slagoffer, Alice Nonjoli, bevestig.   Gedurende die kruisverhoor van Bojosi en
Moloi is dit namens beskuldigde 71 aan hulle gestel dat beskuldigde 71 in die
tydperk vanaf Mei tot September 1992 in Natal was.   Hy verskyn egter op die
video wat op 18 Junie 1992 by KwaMadala geneem is.      In sy getuienis het

hy erken dat hy reeds by sy arrestasie besluit het om =n leuen te vertel oor waar
hy op 17 Junie 1992 was.   In die lig van sy valse alibi het die Verhoorhof
tereg bevind dat die Staat sy saak teen beskuldigde 71 op die grondslag van
gesamentlike doel  bo redelike twyfel bewys het.
Beskuldigde 73
Dit is uit al die getuienis duidelik dat beskuldigde 73 =n leiersrol in
KwaMadala gespeel het.    Hy was die president van die beheerkomitee en
hoof-behuisingsbeampte.   Volgens sy eie getuienis is geen vergadering van
inwoners sonder sy goedkeuring gehou nie.      Volgens Moloi en Mnqithi het
beskuldigde 73 by die vergadering die betrokke aand die aanvallers met
Ntelezi besprinkel.    Hy was by die hek toe die groep uitgaan en het daar vir
hulle gewag toe hulle terugkom.     Moloi en Theresa Mofokeng het getuig dat
beskuldigde 73 die volgende dag opdrag gegee het dat die gesteelde goedere
verbrand moet word.

Beskuldigde 73 het getuig dat hy een van diegene is wat uit KwaMazisa
gevlug het na KwaMadala.     Hy was werksaam by Iscor  en is aan die begin
van Maart 1992 deur die inwoners gekies as die verantwoordelike
behuisingsbeampte om beheer uit te oefen oor nuwe intrekkers by
KwaMadala.    Hy het bevestig dat KwaMadala =n toevlugsoord geword het vir
Inkatha-lede  wat uit ander woonbuurtes verdryf is.   Die besluit oor wie
toegelaat word by KwaMadala het vanaf  Maart 1992 by hom berus.   Hy was
in beheer van die stoorkamer waar vuurwapens gestoor is.     Beskuldigde 73
het ontken dat daar enige vergadering van inwoners die betrokke aand in
KwaMadala gehou is of dat enige aanval op Boipatong vanuit KwaMadala
geloods is.    Sy getuienis is tereg as vals deur die Verhoorhof verwerp.  In al
die omstandighede kan daar nie die geringste twyfel bestaan nie dat hy een
van die beplanners van die aanval was wat =n voorafgaande ooreenkoms
gesluit het om =n gewapende aanval op Boipatong te loods.    Hy is gevolglik

korrek skuldig bevind.
Beskuldigde 74
Bojosi het getuig dat beskuldigde 74 deelgeneem het aan die aanval met
=n haelgeweer.    Moloi het getuig dat beskuldigde 74 by die vergadering gesê
het dat hy nie kan saamgaan na Boipatong toe nie omdat die mense daar hom
ken.   Hy het ook nie vir beskuldigde 74 daar gesien nie.   Theresa Mofokeng
het getuig dat sy saam met beskuldigde 74 en ander in dieselfde kamer
gewoon het.    Die betrokke aand het beskuldigde 74 =n vergadering in die
stadion bygewoon en na =n rukkie het hy =n lap en wapens in die kamer kom
haal.    Die dag na die aanval het sy gesien dat beskuldigde 74 =n televisiestel
na die vuur dra.
Beskuldigde 74 het getuig dat hy voorheen =n polisiebeampte was en dat
hy na aanvalle op homself en sy familie gedurende 1991 in KwaMadala gaan
woon het.     Theresa Mofokeng het soms by hom in sy kamer geslaap.  Op die

betrokke aand was sy by hom in sy kamer.      Hy weet niks van enige
vergadering wat op die betrokke aand gehou is nie en dra ook geen kennis van
enige aanval op Boipatong nie.   Sy getuienis is tereg as vals deur die
Verhoorhof verwerp en hy is korrek skuldig bevind op die basis van
gemeenskaplike doel.
Bygevolg word die appèlle van al die beskuldigdes afgewys.

HARMS AR/

HARMS AR:
[1] Sedert die opheffing van die maritale mag het <n vrou getroud
binne gemeenskap van goed dieselfde bevoegdhede met betrekking tot die
aangaan van skulde wat van die gemeenskaplike boedel verhaal kan word
as wat die man vantevore gehad het.  In die algemeen gesproke mag elke
gade sonder die ander se toestemming nou regshandelinge aangaan wat
die gemeenskaplike boedel betrek (Wet op Huweliksgoedere 88 van
1984, veral arts 13, 14 en 15(1)).  Daar is uitsonderings waarvan twee
vervat in art 15(2) tans ter sake is.  Een gade mag nie sonder die
skriftelike toestemming van die ander gade -
""(c)
enige ..... vaste deposito's of enige derglike bates, of <n
belegging deur of ten behoewe van die ander gade in <n
finansiële instelling, wat deel van die gemeenskaplike boedel
uitmaak, ..... sedeer of verpand nie;”
of

“(h)
hom as borg verbind nie.""
Terloops, in hierdie Wet sluit die manlike nog die vroulike in.  In die
geval van borgstelling word bykomend vereis dat die toestemming deur
twee bevoegde getuies geattesteer moet word (art 15(5)).  <n Transaksie
sonder die voorgeskrewe toestemming is nietig tensy die derde party nie
geweet het en rederlikwys nie kon geweet het dat die transaksie in stryd
met die verbod gesluit is nie (art 15(9)(a)).  Indien <n gade toestemming
weerhou of  ""wanneer die toestemming om <n ander rede nie verkry kan
word nie"" mag die hof toestemming verleen (art 16(1)).
[2] Op 7 Desember 1994 teken mev Burger (die respondent) <n
dokument waarin sy <n vaste deposito van R500 000 by Saambou Bank
aan die appellant sedeer en haarself as borg en mede-hoofskuldenaar jeens
die appellant verbind. Omdat die bewoording van die onderneming ter

sake is, haal ek dit aan:
""The Procurement Manager
Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Company Limited
. . ..
AGREEMENT BETWEEN VAAL REEFS EXPLORATION AND MINING
COMPANY LIMITED (COMPANY) AND MICHETTE MINING
SERVICES (PTY) LTD (CONTRACTOR) FOR THE MINING OF
AFRIKANDER LEASE DIVISION
With reference to the abovementioned agreement I, Mrs Brenda
Benjamin Burger, ID No. 4305050064004 hereby cede all title to
Bank Account No. 11994091009 held at Saambou Bank,
Potchefstroom to Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Company
Limited and hereby bind myself jointly and severally as Surety and
co-principal debtor in solidum with the contractor for the sum of .
. . FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND RAND (R500 000,00) in
respect of the contractor fulfilling all his obligations in terms of the
contract and I hereby specifically renounce the benefit of the
exceptions non causa debiti and ordinis seu excussionis and
division.
I agree that, should you grant the contractor any extension of time
for the fulfilment of the said contract, such extension shall not
affect your rights in terms of this bond.
Upon me receiving written notice from the Procurement Manager,
Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Company Limited, that the
contractor is in default in terms of the contract, I undertake to pay
the face value of this bond forthwith to the company, irrespective
of the reason which caused the contractor to default. Such payment

being without prejudice to any rights the company may have in
terms of the contract.
This bond is neither negotiable nor transferable.  This bond shall
remain valid until the contractor's obligations have been fulfilled in
terms of the contract.”
Sy teken as ""Mrs Brenda Benjamin Burger"" en twee getuies attesteer die
onderneming.
[3] Mev Burger is sedert 13 Julie 1963 met ene Victor Burger
getroud.  Die huwelik is in gemeenskap van goed. Hy is tydens <n
motorongeluk beseer en as gevolg daarvan het die Hooggeregshof (TPA)
op 17 Maart 1992 hom op aansoek van mev Burger ""geestelik verstoord
verklaar ..... en derhalwe onbekwaam ..... om sy eie belange te behartig.""
Sy is aangestel as die kurator ten aansien van sy persoon en goedere en
die magte en bevoegdhede waarmee sy beklee is, is in <n aanhangsel
uitgestip.  Van belang is par 4 en 6:

“4.
Om enige eiendom wat aan die pasiënt behoort, of
waarin hy <n belang mag hê te verhuur, verruil, onderverdeel
of vervreem; of vir enige regsgeldige rede te verpand, of met
verband te beswaar.”
“6.
Om enige bevoegdheid uit te oefen, of om
toestemming te verleen wat benodig word vir die uitoefening
van sodanige bevoegdheid; waar sodanige bevoegdheid in
die pasiënt gevestig is vir sy eie voordeel, of waar die
bevoegdhede van <n voordelige aard vir die pasiënt skyn te
wees.”
[4] Met dié dat die hoofskuldenaar nie sy verpligtinge teenoor
die appellant nakom nie, spreek die appellant met 'n beroep op die sessie
en ook op die borgstelling vir mev Burger aan, o a, om betaling van R500
000 (sy het, terloops, ten spyte van die sessie die deposito onttrek).  Mev
Burger verweer haarself teen die eis veral op grond daarvan dat die sessie
en borgstelling nie jeens haar geldig en bindend is nie.  Nadat die
appellant in repliek met sekere van hierdie bewerings gehandel het en

verder in geskil getree het , is die hof  benede versoek om vooraf te
oorweeg of die sessie en borgstelling geldig is.  Aan die versoek is
voldoen en na die aanhoor van getuienis is beslis dat haar onderneming
nietig is.  Die eis is met koste afgewys.  Verlof tot appèl is deur die
verhoorhof geweier maar <n aansoek om verlof gerig aan die Hoofregter
was suksesvol.
[5] Met verwysing na die bepalings van art 15 van die Wet
beweer mev Burger ten aanvang dat haar man nie sy skriftelike
toestemming tot die sessie ingevolge art 15(2)(c) of tot die borgstelling in
terme van art 15(2)(h) gegee het nie.  (Dit is gemeensaak dat die hof nie
die transaksie ingevolge art 16(1) gemagtig het nie.)  Die repliek van die
appellant is te dien effekte dat mev Burger, vanweë haar aanstelling as
kurator, nie haar man se toestemming benodig nie en dat, in ieder geval,

sy  namens hom aan haarself toestemming gegee het toe sy die dokument
onderteken het.
[6] De Villiers R het ten aansien van hierdie geskilpunt bevind
dat die hofbevel aan mev Burger die bevoegdheid verleen om aan haarself
toestemming te gee om <n borgakte te sluit. (Ek hou voorlopig sy
benadering oor die sessie ietwat agterweë.)  Namens mev Burger is in die
hof benede en hier ook betoog dat dit verkeerd is omdat <n borgstelling
nie, ooreenkomstig die bewoording van par 6, vir die voordeel van Burger
kon wees nie.  Die verhoorhof het egter beslis dat die bevoegdheid wat in
Burger “vir sy eie voordeel gevestig het” juis die bevoegdheid was om
toestemming tot borgstelling te verleen en dat dít is wat in mev Burger
setel en dat dit iets anders is as om te sê dat alleen waar die uitoefening
van die bevoegdheid voordeel vir die pasiënt (Victor Burger) inhou dit

uitgeoefen kan word.  Tensy die kar voor die perde ingespan is,
voorveronderstel sowel die pleit en die uitspraak as die betoog dat die
hofbevel borgstelling magtig.
[7] Ten spyte van sy bevinding dat par 6 die verlening van
toestemming magtig, het De Villiers R beslis dat mev Burger regtens nie
die bevoegdheid aan haarself  kon verleen nie omdat daar voldoende steun
vir die beginsel sou bestaan dat een persoon nie as verteenwoordiger van
<n ander met homself <n kontrak kan sluit nie.  Eweneens sou mev Burger
nie regtens as verteenwoordiger van haar man aan haarself in haar
persoonlike hoedanigheid skriftelike toestemming kon verleen om die
borgkontrak aan te gaan nie.  Die beginsel waarop die verhoorhof steun,
het skynbaar sy ontstaan in prof J C De Wet se oorspronklike bydrae in
1 LAWSA par 107.  Hy het dit as vanselfsprekend beskou dat een

persoon nie as verteenwoordiger van <n ander met homself <n kontrak kan
sluit nie omdat ""a contract is a juristic act for which expressions of
common intention by at least two persons are required"" en omdat ""a
contract can only come into being by agreement between at least two
persons.""  So ook Du Plessis in 1 LAWSA 1st re-issue par 106.  Ek vind
egter nie 'n soortgelyke opmerking deur prof De Wet in Kontraktereg en
Handelsreg 5e uitgawe nie.  Hierdie motivering vir die reël is natuurlik
nie van toepassing en kan nie van toepassing gemaak word op die huidige
geval nie omdat toestemming soos in art 15(2) in die vooruitsig gestel, <n
bloot eensydige regshandeling is.
[8] <n Mens sou amper kon sê cessante ratio cessat lex, maar dit
sou impliseer dat ek dit met prof De Wet eens is oor die bestaan van 'n
algemene regsreël soos deur hom geformuleer.  Daar is gevalle waar die

reg nie sulke transaksies gedoog nie.  Voorbeelde is waar <n voog sy pupil
se goed koop of <n verkoopsagent self die saak inkoop (vgl Osry v Hirsch,
Loubser & Co Ltd 1922 CPD 531) maar hierdie gevalle word gewoonlik
onder die hofie van  troubreuk tuisgebring (Kontraktereg en Handelsreg
p 387).  Die geval wat in Gutman NO v Standard General Insurance Co
Ltd 1981 (4) SA 114 (C) ter sprake gekom het, kan egter beswaarlik oor
dieselfde kam geskeer word. Daar het die eienaar van <n besigheid die
besigheid verkoop aan <n maatskappy wat, vir huidige doeleindes, aan
hom alleen behoort het.  Die bevinding in Gutman dat vanweë die feit dat
die eienaar ook namens sy maatskappy opgetree het die kontrak nietig is,
is onrealisties.  Die behoeftes van die regsverkeer is nie in ag geneem nie.
Om <n paar retoriese vrae te vra: Hoe leen <n alleen-aandeelhouer en
enkeldirekteur geld aan sy maatskappy of omgekeerd?  Hoe word bates

tussen sulke partye vervreem?  Hoe geskied transaksies tussen verwante
maatskappye?  Dis immers <n alledaagse verskynsel dat <n persoon in twee
hoedanighede optree.  Afgesien van die praktiese, stem ek nie met prof
De Wet se teoretiese grondslag saam nie.  Die wil van die
verteenwoordiger is, van regsweë, die wil van die sg prinsipaal en nie sy
eie nie.  As die verteenwoordiger in <n geval soos Gutman kontrakteer,
vind die uitdrukking van <n gesamentlike bedoeling van twee persone
plaas. Samevattend dus op hierdie aspek, ek is van oordeel dat daar
regtens geen belet op mev Burger rus om haarself in <n geval soos die
huidige toestemming te verleen nie.
[9] Hierdie uitstappie bring <n mens ongelukkig nie nader aan die
oplossing nie.  Die vraag wat na regte gevra moet word, betrek die
trefwydte van art 15, veral die toestemmingsvereiste.  Dit kan gerieflik

aan die hand van <n voorbeeld of twee getoets word.  Bv, art 15(3)(a)
magtig die een gade om met die toestemming, wat selfs mondeling of
stilswyend kan wees, sekere losgoed te vervreem.  Die hofbevel voorsien
aan mev Burger die identiese bevoegdheid.  Sy wil <n meubelstuk
verkoop.  Sy mag, volgens die hofbevel sonder meer en volgens die Wet
met haar man se toestemming.  Moet sy nou in haar hoedanigheid as
kurator haarself mondeling of stilswyend toestemming gee? <n Verder
illustrasie: Sy wil vaste eiendom verkoop.  Kragtens art 15(2)(a) benodig
sy die skriftelike toestemming van haar man geattesteer deur twee
bevoegde getuies. Volgens die hofbevel het sy die bevoegdheid sonder <n
toestemming, skriftelik of andersins.  Moet sy nou aan haarself die statutêr
vereiste toestemming met al die gekoppelde formaliteite gee of moet sy
die hof ingevolge art 16(1) nader om 'n toestemming wat sy alreeds het?

Na my oordeel toon hierdie eenvoudige voorbeelde dat die vereiste van
toestemming soos vervat in art 15 nie van toepassing kan wees op <n
buitengewone geval soos die huidige waar die handelende eggenoot uit 'n
ander bron 'n bestaande magtiging het om die boedel te bind nie.  Enige
ander gevolgtrekking lei tot absurde gevolge, iets wat die wetsuitlegger
moet vermy.  Die vraag of mev Burger aan haarself toestemming kon gee
en inderdaad gegee het, verval gevolglik.
[10] Die feit dat die vormvereistes van art 15 nie op mev Burger
van toepassing is nie, beteken nie noodwendig dat sy sonder meer die
gemeenskaplike boedel kan verbind nie.  Haar bevoegdheid om die boedel
te verbind, spruit immers uit die hofbevel.  In hierdie verband is haar
verweer dat  'n sessie nie binne haar algemene bevoegdhede as kurator val
nie.

[11] Die sessie van die bankrekening is, ten spyte van die
bewoording,  klaarblyklik nie <n uit-en- uit sessie nie.  Inderdaad is dit <n
sessie van die regte in die vaste deposito van R500 000 ter versekering
van <n skuld.  Par 4 van die aangehaalde hofbevel verleen wel aan mev
Burger die bevoegdheid om enige eiendom wat aan Victor Burger
(oftewel die gemeenskaplike boedel) behoort ""vir enige regsgeldige rede
te verpand"".  Aangesien <n sessie ter versekering van <n skuld <n vorm van
verpanding is, het mev Burger dus die bevoegdheid kragtens die hofbevel
om so <n sessie te bewerkstellig. Wat art 15 betref, het die hof benede  in
die lig van 'n toegewing aanvaar dat sy vanweë die bepalings van art
15(2)(c) saamgelees met art 15(7) bevoeg was om hierdie regte sonder
haar man se toestemming regsgeldig in securitatem debiti te sedeer.  Of
hierdie uitgangspunt  korrek is al dan nie is eintlik nie ter sake nie omdat

ek reeds bevind het dat die toestemmingsvereiste hoegenaamd nie op die
saak van toepassing is nie.
[12] Na regte behoort dit op enigeen van die twee benaderings die
einde van haar verweer te wees. Die verhoorregter het hierdie probleem
oorkom deur te bevind dat die borgstelling nietig is (ek behandel sy redes
hierna) en dat die sessie met dieselfde lot getref word omdat die sessie
aksessoor tot die borgverpligting is, 'n benadering wat namens mev Burger
onderskryf word.  Volgens my oordeel staaf nóg die onderneming nóg die
getuienis die siening dat die sessie aksessoor tot die borgverpligting is.
Aksessoor is die sessie wel, maar t o v die hoofskuld.  Beide die sessie en
die borgstelling onderskryf die hoofskuld.  Hulle staan langs mekaar maar
die een is nie ondergeskik aan of afhanklik van die ander nie.  Die twee
is volgens algemene beginsels skeibaar.  Die moontlike nietigheid van die

borgstelling raak dus nie die geldigheid van die sessie nie.  Die
afdwingbaarheid van die hoofskuld is immers nie in geskil nie.  Hierdie
gevolgtrekking bring ook <n einde aan die betoog dat die verpanding slegs
geldig kan wees as dit ooreenkomstig die hofbevel, ""vir <n regsgeldige
rede"" geskied en dat, omdat die borgstelling nietig is, die sessie nie om <n
regsgeldige rede plaasgevind het nie.
[13] Die vraag of die hofbevel, in besonder par 6 daarvan, aan
mev Burger die bevoegdheid verleen om namens haar man <n
borgverpligting aan te gaan, is - anders as die sessie - nie op die
pleitstukke <n geskil nie.  Soos gepleit en betoog, is die vraag of sy die
bevoegdheid gehad het om aan haarself namens haar man toestemming te
verleen om deur haar handtekening die gemeenskaplike boedel te bind.
Hierdie bevoegdheid om toe te stem, het die verhoorhof in die hofbevel

gevind, maar bevind dat die formele toestemmingsvereiste van art 15 (2)
ontbreek.  Ek het reeds die gles in die tweede been uitgewys.  Die eerste
been is dus ontersaaklik.
[14] Ten tye van die hofbevel was die bepalings van artikels 14,
15 en 16 van die Wet nie op hierdie huwelik van toepassing nie omdat die
huwelik voor die inwerkingtreding van die Wet gesluit is.  Alvorens sy die
onderneming geteken het, is art 11 van die Wet gewysig en sedertdien is
die gemelde artikels op alle huwelike binne gemeenskap van goed van
toepassing, ongeag die datum van sluiting daarvan (art 29 van die Vierde
Algemene Regswysigingswet 132 van 1993).  Gevolglik het mev Burger
eers haar statutêre bevoegdheid gekry om 'n borgkontrak te sluit nadat die
hofbevel verleen is.  Of die hofbevel <n soortgelyke magtiging bevat, hang
af van die uitleg van par 6 en, meer in besonder, of die bevoegdheid

omsluit word deur die frase ""enige bevoegdheid"" wat daarin voorkom.
Hoewel die begrip met die eerste oogopslag onbegrens skyn te wees, is
dit opvallend dat die ander paragrawe van die bevel spesifieke
bevoegdhede soos vervreemding, verpanding en dies meer uitdruklik
verleen.  Dit is dus onwaarskynlik dat so <n verreikende bevoegdheid soos
borgstelling onder <n algemene bewoording tuisgebring sou word.
Opmerklik is verder dat die vermoë van mev Burger ""om enige
bevoegdheid uit te oefen"" daardeur gekwalifiseer word dat ""sodanige
bevoegdheid in [Victor Burger] gevestig is vir sy eie voordeel.""  Dis nie
moontlik om die gemeenregtelike vermoë van die beheerder van die
gemeenskaplike boedel om die boedel deur <n borgakte te bind, onder
daardie kwalifikasie tuis te bring nie.
[15] As mev Burger volgens die hofbevel nie die bevoegdheid

gehad het om die gemeenskaplike boedel met 'n borgakte te bind nie,
ontstaan die vraag of die wetswysiging aan haar hierdie bevoegdheid
gegee het.   Aangesien die vraag nie voor ons gedebatteer is nie, laat ek
die probleem onopgelos.
[16] Al sou die borgstelling ongeldig wees, affekteer dit nie die
sessie se geldigheid nie.  Gevolglik moet die appèl slaag.  Omdat daar
uitstaande geskilpunte is, word die bevel van die hof benede met 'n
verklarende bevel vervang.  Hierdie saak illustreer egter die noodsaak om
by die aanstelling van kuratore meer aandag te skenk aan die formulering
van hulle magte.  Die bevel ter sprake is op lukrake wyse opgestel en die
bewoording is nie alleen onbevredigend nie maar ook teenstrydig.  Selfs
die gebruik van leestekens is ontoepaslik.  Die bevoegdhede van kuratore
moet spesifiek omlyn word en daar behoort onderskei te word tussen

bevoegdhede wat <n kurator sonder meer kan uitoefen, dié wat met die
Meester se goedkeuring uitgeoefen moet word en daardie wat
hoegenaamd nie toegeken word nie.  Borgstelling behoort nie in die eerste
kategorie te val nie.
[17] Die appèl slaag met koste en die bevel van die hof a quo
word vervang met <n bevel wat -
(a)
verklaar dat die onderneming van 7 Desember 1994 nie ongeldig
is weens die bewerings gemaak in par 8 en 9(a) van die pleit nie;
(b)
die verweerderes gelas word om die koste verbonde aan die aparte
beregting te betaal.

[1]          Ek het die voordeel gehad om die uitspraak van Harms AR te

dat die sessie aksessoor t.o.v. die hoofskuld is en nie die borgverpligting
nie.  Appellant (eiser) se saak was juis die teendeel.  In bede (c) het
appellant uitdruklik gevra vir ‘n verklarende bevel “declaring the plaintiff
to be holding as security for the aforesaid claim against the defendant [nie
die hoofskuldenaar nie]  the proceeds standing to the credit of account
number 11994091009 with Saambou Bank and declaring the plaintiff to
be entitled to the proceeds so standing to the credit of such account up to
a maximum of R500 000,00"".  (My beklemtoning.)   As appellant sou
beweer het dat die sessie ter onderskraging van die hoofskuldenaar se
verpligting gegee was, sou respondent dit moontlik betwis het en, indien
nodig, in die alternatief gepleit het dat, as die ooreenkoms anders vertolk
moet word dit nie ‘n juiste weerspieëling van die gemeenskaplike
bedoeling was nie.
[2]          Die bede berus ook, na my mening, op die korrekte vertolking
van die dokument.  Nêrens is daar enigiets daarin te vinde wat sou aandui

dat die sessie nie ter ondersteuning van die borgstelling was nie maar ter
ondersteuning van die hoofskuldenaar se skuld.  Trouens, sonder die
meegaande borgstelling sou dit moeilik gewees het om te konkludeer dat
die sessie nie ‘n uit en uit sessie maar ‘n sessie in securitatem debiti was.
Selfs as die mondelinge getuienis voor die hof a quo as toelaatbaar beskou
word nieteenstaande die afwesigheid van enige eis vir rektifikasie deur die
appellant, is daar geen stawing vir so ‘n bevinding nie.  Dit is nie
verbasend nie want, soos ek voorheen gesê het, was dit nie die appellant
se saak dat die sessie ter ondersteuning van die hoofskuld was nie.  Toe
die appellant se advokaat die appellant se saak geopen het, het hy gesê
“Your Lordship will note, it is a composite document this.  It has two
elements; it has a cession and it has a suretyship.  No doubt the defendant
will contend that it (sic) is inextricably tied up and interdependent.”  Die
respondent se advokaat het op sy beurt die volgende gesê: “In the
plaintiff’s particulars of claim what they claim is firstly ..................
payment of the amount of R500 000,00 which is the amount of the
suretyship, and then in prayer (c) a declarator to the effect that the plaintiff
is holding as security the cession of the investment.  So what plaintiff (my
onderstreping) contends is that they are interrelated and the cession was
done as a security, and the argument of the defendant in that regard would

be that that is specifically excluded by the powers bestowed on the
curatrix in terms of the court order.  She cannot cede anything unless it is
for a valid reason.”  Hy het later gesê:  “If your Lordship finds that the
suretyship was valid, then the matter will continue as to whether there was
any indebtedness, and everything is dependent on the principal debtor’s
indebtedness.  If your Lordship finds that the suretyship is valid (sic - hy
het klaarblyklik “invalid” bedoel) in law, then the defendant contends that
the plaintiff’s claim cannot succeed at all.”  Kort daarna het die hof gesê:
“You say a finding on the validity of the suretyship is simultaneously a
finding on the validity of the cession?”  Die antwoord was: “Yes, and I
would point out to your Lordship that in terms of the powers given to the
curatrix, ............. she cannot pledge anything....................................”
Laasgenoemde verwysing was na die woorde “of vir enige regsgeldige
rede te verpand, of met verband te verswaar” in paragraaf 4 van die
aanhangsel tot die hofbevel.  Daar was daarna geen poging aangewend om
aan te toon dat die sessie nie ter ondersteuning van die borgstelling was
nie of dat dit van die borgstelling skeibaar was nie.
[3]          Ek glo nie dat dit gesê kan word dat die sessie en die
borgstelling volgens algemene beginsels skeibaar is nie.  Geen sodanige
betoog is deur appellant se advokaat geopper nie.  Die blote feit dat die

sessie se ware juridiese kleur (in securitatem debiti) slegs bepaalbaar is
as gevolg van sy koppeling aan die borgstelling is op sigself ‘n sterk
aanduiding dat hulle nie bedoel was om skeibaar te wees nie.
[4]          Nog ‘n aanduiding dat hulle nie selfstandige en skeibare
verpligtings is nie is dat die enigste verwysing in die betrokke dokument
na ‘n beperking van aanspreeklikheid tot die bedrag van R500 000,00 in
die borgstelling gedeelte daarvan(as daar van gedeeltes gepraat kan word)
te vinde is.  As die borgstelling weggedink word, word die sessie nie
alleen ‘n uit en uit sessie nie maar ook ‘n sessie van al die geld wat tot die
krediet van die betrokke rekening mag staan.  Selfs as dit nog steeds as
‘n sessie in securitatem debiti beskou sou kan word, en selfs as aanvaar
kan word dat die sessie ter ondersteuning van die hoofskuld was, as die
bedrag bv R600 000,00 was en as die hoofskuldenaar dieselfde of ‘n
groter bedrag verskuldig was, sou dit volg dat die hele R600 000,00 deur
die skuldeiser aangewend sou kon word ter betaling van die skuld.  Dit
was seer sekerlik nie die bedoeling van die partye nie en dit sou lynreg
met die gewone betekenis van die  betrokke dokument bots.
[5]          Die gevolg hiervan is dat die saak benader moet word op die

grondslag dat, soos deur die hof a quo bevind, die sessie en die
borgstelling nie van mekaar geskei kan word nie en dat, as dit so is dat die
borgstelling ongeldig is, dit moet  volg dat die sessie, as aksessore
verpligting, onafdwingbaar is.  Dit is derhalwe nodig om te beslis of daar
enige ander grondslag is waarop bevind kan word dat die sessie en
borgstelling geldig en afdwingbaar is.
[6]          Uit die aard van die saak kon die hof wat mev Burger as kurator
aangestel het nie die bepalings van art 14 en 15 in gedagte gehad het nie
want daardie bepalings was destyds nie van toepassing op die huwelik
nie. Daar was destyds geen statutêre beperking op die gemeenregtelike
bevoegdheid van die pasiënt om ‘n borgstelling aan te gaan en die
gemeenskaplike boedel daardeur te verbind nie.  Toe die hof besluit het
om die pasiënt se gade as sy kurator aan te stel wel wetend dat hulle binne
gemeenskap van goedere getroud is, moes dit besef het dat, as gevolg van
die aanstelling, mev Burger die enigste persoon sou wees met die
bevoegdheid om namens beide hom en die gemeenskaplike boedel op te
tree.  Gegewe die intieme verhouding tussen haar en die pasiënt, die
mutualiteit van belange, en die praktiese probleme waarvoor sy te staan
sou kom in haar daaglikse lewe indien sy nie vir alle doeleindes met die

bevoegdhede van die pasiënt beklee sou word nie, was dit te verwagte dat
die hof wye magte aan haar sou toestaan.
[7]          Volgens paragraaf 2 van die bevel word mev Burger “aangestel
.......as kurator tot sy persoon en goedere en met die bevoegdheid en
magtiging beklee........... om in die algemeen alle sake met betrekking tot
sy persoon en goedere te behartig, ooreenkomstig die voorskrifte van
aanhangsel ‘A’ ........”.  Sommige van die voorskrifte is deur Harms AR
aangehaal.  As daar gekyk word na die verreikende magte deur die hof
aan mev Burger verleen, is die moeilik om te bevind dat sy nie gemagtig
was om ‘n borgstelling aan te gaan wat die gemeenskaplike boedel sou
verbind nie.   Trouens, as sy nie daardeur gemagtig was om dit te doen
nie, sou daar destyds niemand gewees het wat bevoeg sou wees om dit te
doen nie.  Ek vind dit moeilik om te aanvaar dat dit die hof se bedoeling
was.
[8]          Toe die tersaaklike bepalings van die Wet toepaslik gemaak is
op huwelike binne gemeenskap van goed wat voor die inwerkingtreding
van die Wet  gesluit is, was Mev Burger alreeds deur die hof as kurator
aangestel en gemagtig om haar eggenoot en die gemeenskaplike boedel

ooreenkomstig ‘n  borgstelling te verbind.  Die feit dat die wysiging van
die Wet daarna op hulle van toepassing geword het, het meegebring dat
sy in haar eie reg magte bekom het wat sy nie voorheen gehad het nie,
maar dit het nie die magte deur die hof aan haar verleen toe sy as kurator
aangestel is tot ‘n einde gebring of beperk nie.  Sy het bevoeg geword as
gevolg van art 14 van die Wet om ‘n borgstelling namens haarself aan te
gaan en die gemeenskaplike boedel daardeur te verbind mits sy haar
eggenoot se skriftelike toestemming bekom het.  Sy was alreeds bevoeg
as gevolg van haar aanstelling deur die hof om namens haar eggenoot ‘n
borgstelling aan te gaan en die gemeenskaplike boedel te verbind.  Die
gekombineerde uitwerking van die aanstelling as kurator en die wysiging
van die Wet was in wese om sy en haar eggenoot se juridiese
bevoegdhede in haar te verenig.
[9]          Ek is met Harms AR dit eens dat so ‘n geval nie deur art 15 (2)
geraak is nie.  Die bepaling het betrekking op ‘n situasie waar die gade
wat die betrokke regshandeling wil verrig die toestemming van die ander
gade nodig het en dit nog nie het nie. In hierdie geval was mev Burger
beklee met die bevoegdheid om die regshandelinge te verrig wat sy verrig
het.  Om die redes deur Harms AR uitgestip sou dit absurd wees om

daarop aan te dring dat sy toestemming aan haarself op die formalistiese
wyse in die Wet uiteengesit moet gee voordat sy ‘n party tot ‘n
regsgeldige transaksie kan wees.
[10]         Ek  stem  ook  saam met  Harms  AR  se  opmerkings  i.v.m.
prof de Wet  se  siening  in  sy  oorspronklike  bydrae  in 1 LAWSA par
107 dat “a contract  can  only  come  into  being  by  agreement  between
at  least  two persons”.
[11]          Na my mening moet die appèl slaag met koste en die bevel van
die hof a quo  vervang word met die volgende bevel:
“(a)
It is declared that the cession in securitatem debiti
and the suretyship obligation contained in the
undertaking of 7 December 1994 are valid in law and
binding upon the joint estate;
(b)
Defendant is ordered to pay the costs attributable to
the separate hearing of specific issues.”

APPèLREGTER

VAN HEERDEN AHR
Ek gaan akkoord met die siening van Harms AR dat, op ‘n uitleg
van die tersaaklike dokument, die sessie nie aksessoor tot die respondent
se borgverpligting is nie.  Ek twyfel egter of so ‘n konstruksie behoorlik
in die pleitstukke geopper of in geskil gestel is.  Aangesien ek saamstem
met die mening van Marais AR dat die borgstelling geldig is, is dit egter
onnodig om verder op hierdie aspek in te gaan .
Ek stem dus ook saam met die bevele wat Marais AR in die
vooruitsig stel.

VAN HEERDEN AHR
[1] Op  2 Julie  1991 het  die appellant <n  lewenspolis  ten  bedrae van R200 000
aan die tans wyle C J Roux uitgereik.  Dit het geskied op grond van <n aansoekvorm
wat deur die oorledene voltooi was.  Na sy dood het die appellant geweier om die
voordeel wat ingevolge die polis deur die oorledene se boedel geeis is, te betaal. Die
respondente, in hul hoedanighede as eksekuteurs van die boedel, het toe in die
Vrystaatse Provinsiale Afdeling <n aksie vir betaling van die voordeel teen die
respondent ingestel.  Laasgenoemde het twee verwere geopper waarvan slegs een
nog ter sake is.  Hierdie verweer se kern was dat die oorledene in die aansoekvorm
materiële onjuiste besonderhede verstrek het wat die appellant oorreed het om die
polis uit te reik.
[2] Die geding het gedien voor Beckley R.  Hy het beide verwere verwerp en
vonnis ten bedrae van R200 000 plus rente ten gunste van die respondente verleen.
Met verlof van hierdie hof kom die appellante nou in hoër beroep.

-3-
[3] In die aansoekvorm het die oorledene (of sy verteenwoordiger) positief
geantwoord op vrae of hy na 1 April 1986 ‘n lewenspolis verkry het nadat hy ‘n
volledige mediese verklaring gemaak het, en of dit ‘n versekeringsplan sonder ‘n
minimum lewensdekking was.  Hierdie antwoorde was onjuis aangesien die betrokke
polis deur Ou Mutual uitgereik was volgende op ‘n aansoekvorm waarin die
oorledene sekere vrae van mediese aard beantwoord het, maar nie ‘n volledige
mediese verklaring gemaak het nie en die polis bowendien wel vir ‘n minimum
lewensdekking voorsiening gemaak het.
[4] In die aansoekvorm betreffende die Ou Mutual polis is slegs drie vrae gestel
(wat ontkennend beantwoord is).  Hulle lui soos volg:
“1
Het enige siekte, besering of ongesteldheid veroorsaak dat u gedurende die
afgelope twee jaar ‘n ononderbroke tydperk van meer as 10 dae in die bed moes
deurbring of nie u normale daaglikse bedrywighede kon voortsit nie?
Ontvang u tans mediese behandeling, of het u gedurende die afgelope 3 jaar
mediese behandeling of medisyne ontvang wat deur ‘n dokter voorgeskryf is?
Is ‘n aansoek om lewens-, siekte-, ongeskiktheids- of ongevalleversekering op u
lewe al ooit afgewys, uitgestel, teruggetrek of op spesiale voorwaardes, of teen
spesiale tariewe, aanvaar?”
‘n Tipiese voorbeeld van ‘n volledige mediese verklaring is te vind in ‘n

-4-
ingevulde aansoekvorm waarin die volgende vrae gestel word:
“Ly u . . . of het u. . . al ooit aan enige van die volgende gely:
JA   NEE
1.
Enige aandoening van die hart, bloedvate of bloedsomloop, bv. hoë bloeddruk,
borspyn, hartgeruis, kroonslagaarsiekte, kortasemigheid of hartkloppings?
9   9
2.
Enige asemhaling- of longaandoening, bv. asma, brongitis, aanhoudende hoes,
tuberkulose?
9   9
3.
Enige siekte van die spysverteringstelsel, galblaas of lewer, bv. hepatitis B,
werklike of vermoedelike maag- of duodenumseer, aanhoudende slegte
spysvertering of diarree, of hiatus-breuk?
9   9
4.
Enige siekte of aandoening van die niere, blaas of geslagsorgane, bv. eiwit in urine,
nierstene, prostatitis, veneriese siekte of ginekologiese simptome of toestande
(d.w.s. probleme met die vroulike organe)?
9   9
5.
Enige senuwee- of geestesmoeilikheid, bv. epilepsie, floute, verlamming,
angsneurose of neerslagtigheid?
9   9
6.
Enige oogkwale of oor-, neus- of keelaandoenings, bv.oorsug, geswelde kliere,
aanhoudende mondsere, gebrekkige visie, katarakte of enige oorerflike
oogsiekte?
9   9
7.
Enige aandoening of siekte van die spiere, skelet, gewrigte, ledemate
of werwelkolom, bv.rumatiek, gewrigsontsteking, jig, verskuifde werwelskyf of ander
rugmoeilikheid?
9   9

8.
Suikersiekte, suiker in urine, skildklier- of ander klier- of bloedkwale?
9   9
9.
Kanker, groeisel of gewas van enige aard, of velkwale?
9   9
10.
Enige ander siekte, simptome, liggaamlike afwyking of gebrek, aangebore of nie,
wat die raadpleging van ‘n mediese praktisyn genoodsaak het (met uitsluiting van
verkoues, griep en algemene kindersiektes)?
9   9
11.
Is daar enige ander gesondheids- of ander faktore (in die verlede of tans) wat die
risiko op hierdie polis kan beïnvloed, . . .”
Die onderhawige aansoekvorm wat deur die oorledene geteken is, se opskrif lui: “Die

-5-
1.2 miljoen Rand spesiale aanbod.”   Paragraaf 9.1 getitel “Spesiale aanbod
verklaring” lui soos volg:
“Ek verklaar dat ek nie sedert 1 Mei 1990 by Liberty Life of enige ander versekeraar aansoek
vir ‘n soortgelyke aanbod gedoen het nie en dat geen aansoek tans deur Liberty Life
oorweeg word nie.  Ek verklaar dat my mees onlangse aansoek sedert 1 April 1986 om
lewensversekering by ‘n Suid-Afrikaanse versekeraar, waarvoor ek ‘n volledige mediese
verklaring afgelê het, teen standaard tariewe aanvaar en uitgereik is . . .   Besonderhede van
so ‘n uitgereikte polis word onder verstrek.
Naam van Maattskappy
Polisnommer
Uitreikingsdatum
OU MUTUAL
5897596
1/10/88
Ek verklaar voorts dat ek nie enige advies, voorligting, behandeling of bloedtoetse (behalwe
vir versekeringsdoeleindes) in verband met VIGS of ‘n VIGS-verwante siekte ontvang het of
na verwagting sal ontvang nie . . . .”
(Die woorde “Ou Mutual”, die polisnommer en die uitreikingsdatum is deur of
namens die oorledene ingevul.)
[5] Alhoewel die oorledene die juistheid van sy antwoorde in die onderhawige
aansoekvorm gewaarborg het, ontstaan die vraag of die appellant hom gekwyt het
van die bewyslas waarvoor art 63(3) van die Versekeringswet 27 van 1943
voorsiening maak.  Daardie subartikel lui soos volg :
“(3)
Ondanks andersluidende bepalings vervat in enige binnelandse polis of in enige
dokument wat op daardie polis betrekking het, word so ‘n polis wat voor of na die
inwerkingtreding van hierdie Wet uitgereik is, nie ongeldig gemaak nie en word die
aanspreeklikheid van ‘n versekeraar daarkragtens nie uitgesluit of beperk nie en
word die verpligtings van die eienaar daarvan nie verhoog nie, weens enige

-6-
voorstelling wat aan ‘n versekeraar gemaak is en nie waar is nie, hetsy daardie
voorstelling as waar gewaarborg is al dan nie, tensy die onjuistheid van bedoelde
voorstelling sodanig is dat dit waarskynlik die berekening van die risiko onder
bedoelde polis wesentlik beïnvloed het ten tyde van die uitreiking of enige
herstelling of hernuwing daarvan.”
[6] Om  redes wat nie duidelik is nie, het die verhoorhof beslis dat die appellant
hom nie van die bewyslas gekwyt het nie.  Blykbaar het Beckley R egter ‘n argument
van die respondent se advokaat aanvaar.  Dit was dat die appellant moes  bewys
het dat die  onjuiste  inligting  die risiko  waaraan die appellant blootgestel is deur die
uitreiking van die onderhawige polis, wesenlik beïnvloed het, en dit nie gedoen het
nie.  Hierdie was natuurlik ‘n  verkeerde benadering.  Die kernvraag is immers of die
juiste inligting die beraming van die risiko na die oordeel van ‘n redelike persoon sou
beïnvloed het,  byvoorbeeld deurdat die appellant eers verdere inligting sou ingewin
het voordat hy sou besluit het om die risiko al of nie te aanvaar (vgl President
Versekeringsmaatskappy Bpk v Trust Bank van Afrika Bpk 1989 (1) SA 208(A) 216
D-F.)   Met  ander  woorde, die vraag  is  nie  net  of  die   juiste  inligting die  risiko
sou beïnvloed  het  nie,  maar  ook  of  dit  ‘n  uitwerking  sou  gehad

-7-
het op die  appellant se beoordeling van die risiko.  (Vgl Qilingele v South African
Mutual Life Assurance Society 1993 (1) SA 69  (A) 75 D-F).
[7] Aan hierdie kriterium is wel voldoen.   Dit is duidelik, beide uit die getuienis en
deur aanwending van gesonde verstand, dat die vraag aangaande ‘n volledige
mediese verklaring gestel is sodat die appellant kon weet of ‘n ander versekeraar
sedert 1986  in die lig van sodanige verklaring ‘n lewenspolis aan die oorledene
uitgereik het.  Indien wel, was daar in die lig van die bevestiging dat die oorledene
se gesondheid daarna nie verswak het nie, weinig rede waarom die appellant nie ook
‘n soortgelyke risiko sou aanvaar nie.  Indien nie, sou die appellant ongetwyfeld òf
nie die risiko aanvaar het nie, òf ‘n volledige verklaring aangevra het sodat dit self die
risiko kon evalueer.  Dit is gevolglik onnodig om in te gaan op die vraag of die tweede
onjuiste antwoord wesenlik in bogenoemde sin was.  Dit kom ook nie daarop aan of
‘n mens die benadering van Kriegler Wnd AR in Qilingele dan wel dié van Schutz AR
in Clifford v Commercial Union Insurance Co of SA Ltd 1998 (4) SA 150 (A) volg nie.

-8-
[8] Die appellant het versoek dat indien die appèl sou slaag die koste van twee
advokate toegelaat moet word.  Na my mening het die appèl egter nie die oploop van
sodanige koste geregverdig nie.
[9] Die appellant het kort voor die verhoor van die appèl afstand gedoen van ‘n
spesiale verweer wat in die verhoorhof geopper is en met koste van die hand gewys
is.  Gevolglik het die appellant se advokaat uit eie beweging toegegee dat die koste
verbonde aan die insluiting van pp 38-67, 79-102, 135, 143-184, en pp 1-4 van
Volume 4, van die oorkonde nie deel van die appèlkoste moet wees nie.  Ook is tereg
toegegee dat ‘n spesiale kostebevel gemaak deur Beckley R moet bly staan.
[10] Gevolglik slaag die appèl met koste uitgeslote die koste meegebring deur die
insluiting van pp 38-67, 79-102, 135, 143-184, en pp 1-4 van Volume 4, van die
oorkonde.   Die bevel van die verhoorhof van 6 Maart 1996  word met die volgende
vervang:
“Die eisers se aksie word met koste afgewys, maar die verweerder word gelas

-9-
om die koste meegebring deur die tweede stel vrae ter voorbereiding vir verhoor,
gedateer 21 Januarie 1997, en die tweede stel vrae ingevolge Hofreël 37(4),
gedateer 22 Januarie 1997, te betaal op die skaal van toepassing tussen prokureur
en eie kliënt”.

U I T S P R A A K
HARMS AR/

HARMS AR:
[1] Sedert die opheffing van die maritale mag het <n vrou getroud
binne gemeenskap van goed dieselfde bevoegdhede met betrekking tot die
aangaan van skulde wat van die gemeenskaplike boedel verhaal kan word
as wat die man vantevore gehad het.  In die algemeen gesproke mag elke
gade sonder die ander se toestemming nou regshandelinge aangaan wat
die gemeenskaplike boedel betrek (Wet op Huweliksgoedere 88 van
1984, veral arts 13, 14 en 15(1)).  Daar is uitsonderings waarvan twee
vervat in art 15(2) tans ter sake is.  Een gade mag nie sonder die
skriftelike toestemming van die ander gade -
""(c)
enige ..... vaste deposito's of enige derglike bates, of <n
belegging deur of ten behoewe van die ander gade in <n
finansiële instelling, wat deel van die gemeenskaplike boedel
uitmaak, ..... sedeer of verpand nie;”
of

“(h)
hom as borg verbind nie.""
Terloops, in hierdie Wet sluit die manlike nog die vroulike in.  In die
geval van borgstelling word bykomend vereis dat die toestemming deur
twee bevoegde getuies geattesteer moet word (art 15(5)).  <n Transaksie
sonder die voorgeskrewe toestemming is nietig tensy die derde party nie
geweet het en rederlikwys nie kon geweet het dat die transaksie in stryd
met die verbod gesluit is nie (art 15(9)(a)).  Indien <n gade toestemming
weerhou of  ""wanneer die toestemming om <n ander rede nie verkry kan
word nie"" mag die hof toestemming verleen (art 16(1)).
[2] Op 7 Desember 1994 teken mev Burger (die respondent) <n
dokument waarin sy <n vaste deposito van R500 000 by Saambou Bank
aan die appellant sedeer en haarself as borg en mede-hoofskuldenaar jeens
die appellant verbind. Omdat die bewoording van die onderneming ter

sake is, haal ek dit aan:
""The Procurement Manager

With reference to the abovementioned agreement I, Mrs Brenda
Benjamin Burger, ID No. 4305050064004 hereby cede all title to
Bank Account No. 11994091009 held at Saambou Bank,
Potchefstroom to Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Company
Limited and hereby bind myself jointly and severally as Surety and
co-principal debtor in solidum with the contractor for the sum of .

respect of the contractor fulfilling all his obligations in terms of the

I agree that, should you grant the contractor any extension of time
for the fulfilment of the said contract, such extension shall not
affect your rights in terms of this bond.
Upon me receiving written notice from the Procurement Manager,
Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Company Limited, that the
contractor is in default in terms of the contract, I undertake to pay
the face value of this bond forthwith to the company, irrespective
of the reason which caused the contractor to default. Such payment

being without prejudice to any rights the company may have in
terms of the contract.
This bond is neither negotiable nor transferable.  This bond shall
remain valid until the contractor's obligations have been fulfilled in

Sy teken as ""Mrs Brenda Benjamin Burger"" en twee getuies attesteer die
onderneming.

Om enige eiendom wat aan die pasiënt behoort, of
waarin hy <n belang mag hê te verhuur, verruil, onderverdeel
of vervreem; of vir enige regsgeldige rede te verpand, of met
verband te beswaar.”
“6.
Om enige bevoegdheid uit te oefen, of om
toestemming te verleen wat benodig word vir die uitoefening
van sodanige bevoegdheid; waar sodanige bevoegdheid in
die pasiënt gevestig is vir sy eie voordeel, of waar die
bevoegdhede van <n voordelige aard vir die pasiënt skyn te
wees.”
[4] Met dié dat die hoofskuldenaar nie sy verpligtinge teenoor
die appellant nakom nie, spreek die appellant met 'n beroep op die sessie
en ook op die borgstelling vir mev Burger aan, o a, om betaling van R500
000 (sy het, terloops, ten spyte van die sessie die deposito onttrek).  Mev
Burger verweer haarself teen die eis veral op grond daarvan dat die sessie
en borgstelling nie jeens haar geldig en bindend is nie.  Nadat die
appellant in repliek met sekere van hierdie bewerings gehandel het en

verder in geskil getree het , is die hof  benede versoek om vooraf te
oorweeg of die sessie en borgstelling geldig is.  Aan die versoek is
voldoen en na die aanhoor van getuienis is beslis dat haar onderneming
nietig is.  Die eis is met koste afgewys.  Verlof tot appèl is deur die
verhoorhof geweier maar <n aansoek om verlof gerig aan die Hoofregter
was suksesvol.
[5] Met verwysing na die bepalings van art 15 van die Wet
beweer mev Burger ten aanvang dat haar man nie sy skriftelike
toestemming tot die sessie ingevolge art 15(2)(c) of tot die borgstelling in
terme van art 15(2)(h) gegee het nie.  (Dit is gemeensaak dat die hof nie
die transaksie ingevolge art 16(1) gemagtig het nie.)  Die repliek van die
appellant is te dien effekte dat mev Burger, vanweë haar aanstelling as
kurator, nie haar man se toestemming benodig nie en dat, in ieder geval,

sy  namens hom aan haarself toestemming gegee het toe sy die dokument
onderteken het.
[6] De Villiers R het ten aansien van hierdie geskilpunt bevind
dat die hofbevel aan mev Burger die bevoegdheid verleen om aan haarself
toestemming te gee om <n borgakte te sluit. (Ek hou voorlopig sy
benadering oor die sessie ietwat agterweë.)  Namens mev Burger is in die
hof benede en hier ook betoog dat dit verkeerd is omdat <n borgstelling
nie, ooreenkomstig die bewoording van par 6, vir die voordeel van Burger
kon wees nie.  Die verhoorhof het egter beslis dat die bevoegdheid wat in
Burger “vir sy eie voordeel gevestig het” juis die bevoegdheid was om
toestemming tot borgstelling te verleen en dat dít is wat in mev Burger
setel en dat dit iets anders is as om te sê dat alleen waar die uitoefening
van die bevoegdheid voordeel vir die pasiënt (Victor Burger) inhou dit

uitgeoefen kan word.  Tensy die kar voor die perde ingespan is,
voorveronderstel sowel die pleit en die uitspraak as die betoog dat die
hofbevel borgstelling magtig.
[7] Ten spyte van sy bevinding dat par 6 die verlening van
toestemming magtig, het De Villiers R beslis dat mev Burger regtens nie
die bevoegdheid aan haarself  kon verleen nie omdat daar voldoende steun
vir die beginsel sou bestaan dat een persoon nie as verteenwoordiger van
<n ander met homself <n kontrak kan sluit nie.  Eweneens sou mev Burger
nie regtens as verteenwoordiger van haar man aan haarself in haar
persoonlike hoedanigheid skriftelike toestemming kon verleen om die
borgkontrak aan te gaan nie.  Die beginsel waarop die verhoorhof steun,
het skynbaar sy ontstaan in prof J C De Wet se oorspronklike bydrae in
1 LAWSA par 107.  Hy het dit as vanselfsprekend beskou dat een

persoon nie as verteenwoordiger van <n ander met homself <n kontrak kan
sluit nie omdat ""a contract is a juristic act for which expressions of
common intention by at least two persons are required"" en omdat ""a
contract can only come into being by agreement between at least two
persons.""  So ook Du Plessis in 1 LAWSA 1st re-issue par 106.  Ek vind
egter nie 'n soortgelyke opmerking deur prof De Wet in Kontraktereg en
Handelsreg 5e uitgawe nie.  Hierdie motivering vir die reël is natuurlik
nie van toepassing en kan nie van toepassing gemaak word op die huidige
geval nie omdat toestemming soos in art 15(2) in die vooruitsig gestel, <n
bloot eensydige regshandeling is.
[8] <n Mens sou amper kon sê cessante ratio cessat lex, maar dit
sou impliseer dat ek dit met prof De Wet eens is oor die bestaan van 'n
algemene regsreël soos deur hom geformuleer.  Daar is gevalle waar die

reg nie sulke transaksies gedoog nie.  Voorbeelde is waar <n voog sy pupil
se goed koop of <n verkoopsagent self die saak inkoop (vgl Osry v Hirsch,
Loubser & Co Ltd 1922 CPD 531) maar hierdie gevalle word gewoonlik
onder die hofie van  troubreuk tuisgebring (Kontraktereg en Handelsreg
p 387).  Die geval wat in Gutman NO v Standard General Insurance Co
Ltd 1981 (4) SA 114 (C) ter sprake gekom het, kan egter beswaarlik oor
dieselfde kam geskeer word. Daar het die eienaar van <n besigheid die
besigheid verkoop aan <n maatskappy wat, vir huidige doeleindes, aan
hom alleen behoort het.  Die bevinding in Gutman dat vanweë die feit dat
die eienaar ook namens sy maatskappy opgetree het die kontrak nietig is,
is onrealisties.  Die behoeftes van die regsverkeer is nie in ag geneem nie.
Om <n paar retoriese vrae te vra: Hoe leen <n alleen-aandeelhouer en
enkeldirekteur geld aan sy maatskappy of omgekeerd?  Hoe word bates

tussen sulke partye vervreem?  Hoe geskied transaksies tussen verwante
maatskappye?  Dis immers <n alledaagse verskynsel dat <n persoon in twee
hoedanighede optree.  Afgesien van die praktiese, stem ek nie met prof
De Wet se teoretiese grondslag saam nie.  Die wil van die
verteenwoordiger is, van regsweë, die wil van die sg prinsipaal en nie sy
eie nie.  As die verteenwoordiger in <n geval soos Gutman kontrakteer,
vind die uitdrukking van <n gesamentlike bedoeling van twee persone
plaas. Samevattend dus op hierdie aspek, ek is van oordeel dat daar
regtens geen belet op mev Burger rus om haarself in <n geval soos die
huidige toestemming te verleen nie.
[9] Hierdie uitstappie bring <n mens ongelukkig nie nader aan die
oplossing nie.  Die vraag wat na regte gevra moet word, betrek die
trefwydte van art 15, veral die toestemmingsvereiste.  Dit kan gerieflik

aan die hand van <n voorbeeld of twee getoets word.  Bv, art 15(3)(a)
magtig die een gade om met die toestemming, wat selfs mondeling of
stilswyend kan wees, sekere losgoed te vervreem.  Die hofbevel voorsien
aan mev Burger die identiese bevoegdheid.  Sy wil <n meubelstuk
verkoop.  Sy mag, volgens die hofbevel sonder meer en volgens die Wet
met haar man se toestemming.  Moet sy nou in haar hoedanigheid as
kurator haarself mondeling of stilswyend toestemming gee? <n Verder
illustrasie: Sy wil vaste eiendom verkoop.  Kragtens art 15(2)(a) benodig
sy die skriftelike toestemming van haar man geattesteer deur twee
bevoegde getuies. Volgens die hofbevel het sy die bevoegdheid sonder <n
toestemming, skriftelik of andersins.  Moet sy nou aan haarself die statutêr
vereiste toestemming met al die gekoppelde formaliteite gee of moet sy
die hof ingevolge art 16(1) nader om 'n toestemming wat sy alreeds het?

Na my oordeel toon hierdie eenvoudige voorbeelde dat die vereiste van
toestemming soos vervat in art 15 nie van toepassing kan wees op <n
buitengewone geval soos die huidige waar die handelende eggenoot uit 'n
ander bron 'n bestaande magtiging het om die boedel te bind nie.  Enige
ander gevolgtrekking lei tot absurde gevolge, iets wat die wetsuitlegger
moet vermy.  Die vraag of mev Burger aan haarself toestemming kon gee
en inderdaad gegee het, verval gevolglik.
[10] Die feit dat die vormvereistes van art 15 nie op mev Burger
van toepassing is nie, beteken nie noodwendig dat sy sonder meer die
gemeenskaplike boedel kan verbind nie.  Haar bevoegdheid om die boedel
te verbind, spruit immers uit die hofbevel.  In hierdie verband is haar
verweer dat  'n sessie nie binne haar algemene bevoegdhede as kurator val
nie.

[11] Die sessie van die bankrekening is, ten spyte van die
bewoording,  klaarblyklik nie <n uit-en- uit sessie nie.  Inderdaad is dit <n
sessie van die regte in die vaste deposito van R500 000 ter versekering
van <n skuld.  Par 4 van die aangehaalde hofbevel verleen wel aan mev
Burger die bevoegdheid om enige eiendom wat aan Victor Burger
(oftewel die gemeenskaplike boedel) behoort ""vir enige regsgeldige rede
te verpand"".  Aangesien <n sessie ter versekering van <n skuld <n vorm van
verpanding is, het mev Burger dus die bevoegdheid kragtens die hofbevel
om so <n sessie te bewerkstellig. Wat art 15 betref, het die hof benede  in
die lig van 'n toegewing aanvaar dat sy vanweë die bepalings van art
15(2)(c) saamgelees met art 15(7) bevoeg was om hierdie regte sonder
haar man se toestemming regsgeldig in securitatem debiti te sedeer.  Of
hierdie uitgangspunt  korrek is al dan nie is eintlik nie ter sake nie omdat

ek reeds bevind het dat die toestemmingsvereiste hoegenaamd nie op die
saak van toepassing is nie.
[12] Na regte behoort dit op enigeen van die twee benaderings die
einde van haar verweer te wees. Die verhoorregter het hierdie probleem
oorkom deur te bevind dat die borgstelling nietig is (ek behandel sy redes
hierna) en dat die sessie met dieselfde lot getref word omdat die sessie
aksessoor tot die borgverpligting is, 'n benadering wat namens mev Burger
onderskryf word.  Volgens my oordeel staaf nóg die onderneming nóg die
getuienis die siening dat die sessie aksessoor tot die borgverpligting is.
Aksessoor is die sessie wel, maar t o v die hoofskuld.  Beide die sessie en
die borgstelling onderskryf die hoofskuld.  Hulle staan langs mekaar maar
die een is nie ondergeskik aan of afhanklik van die ander nie.  Die twee
is volgens algemene beginsels skeibaar.  Die moontlike nietigheid van die

borgstelling raak dus nie die geldigheid van die sessie nie.  Die
afdwingbaarheid van die hoofskuld is immers nie in geskil nie.  Hierdie
gevolgtrekking bring ook <n einde aan die betoog dat die verpanding slegs
geldig kan wees as dit ooreenkomstig die hofbevel, ""vir <n regsgeldige
rede"" geskied en dat, omdat die borgstelling nietig is, die sessie nie om <n
regsgeldige rede plaasgevind het nie.
[13] Die vraag of die hofbevel, in besonder par 6 daarvan, aan
mev Burger die bevoegdheid verleen om namens haar man <n
borgverpligting aan te gaan, is - anders as die sessie - nie op die
pleitstukke <n geskil nie.  Soos gepleit en betoog, is die vraag of sy die
bevoegdheid gehad het om aan haarself namens haar man toestemming te
verleen om deur haar handtekening die gemeenskaplike boedel te bind.
Hierdie bevoegdheid om toe te stem, het die verhoorhof in die hofbevel

gevind, maar bevind dat die formele toestemmingsvereiste van art 15 (2)
ontbreek.  Ek het reeds die gles in die tweede been uitgewys.  Die eerste
been is dus ontersaaklik.
[14] Ten tye van die hofbevel was die bepalings van artikels 14,
15 en 16 van die Wet nie op hierdie huwelik van toepassing nie omdat die
huwelik voor die inwerkingtreding van die Wet gesluit is.  Alvorens sy die
onderneming geteken het, is art 11 van die Wet gewysig en sedertdien is
die gemelde artikels op alle huwelike binne gemeenskap van goed van
toepassing, ongeag die datum van sluiting daarvan (art 29 van die Vierde
Algemene Regswysigingswet 132 van 1993).  Gevolglik het mev Burger
eers haar statutêre bevoegdheid gekry om 'n borgkontrak te sluit nadat die
hofbevel verleen is.  Of die hofbevel <n soortgelyke magtiging bevat, hang
af van die uitleg van par 6 en, meer in besonder, of die bevoegdheid

omsluit word deur die frase ""enige bevoegdheid"" wat daarin voorkom.
Hoewel die begrip met die eerste oogopslag onbegrens skyn te wees, is
dit opvallend dat die ander paragrawe van die bevel spesifieke
bevoegdhede soos vervreemding, verpanding en dies meer uitdruklik
verleen.  Dit is dus onwaarskynlik dat so <n verreikende bevoegdheid soos
borgstelling onder <n algemene bewoording tuisgebring sou word.
Opmerklik is verder dat die vermoë van mev Burger ""om enige
bevoegdheid uit te oefen"" daardeur gekwalifiseer word dat ""sodanige
bevoegdheid in [Victor Burger] gevestig is vir sy eie voordeel.""  Dis nie
moontlik om die gemeenregtelike vermoë van die beheerder van die
gemeenskaplike boedel om die boedel deur <n borgakte te bind, onder
daardie kwalifikasie tuis te bring nie.
[15] As mev Burger volgens die hofbevel nie die bevoegdheid

gehad het om die gemeenskaplike boedel met 'n borgakte te bind nie,
ontstaan die vraag of die wetswysiging aan haar hierdie bevoegdheid
gegee het.   Aangesien die vraag nie voor ons gedebatteer is nie, laat ek
die probleem onopgelos.
[16] Al sou die borgstelling ongeldig wees, affekteer dit nie die
sessie se geldigheid nie.  Gevolglik moet die appèl slaag.  Omdat daar
uitstaande geskilpunte is, word die bevel van die hof benede met 'n
verklarende bevel vervang.  Hierdie saak illustreer egter die noodsaak om
by die aanstelling van kuratore meer aandag te skenk aan die formulering
van hulle magte.  Die bevel ter sprake is op lukrake wyse opgestel en die
bewoording is nie alleen onbevredigend nie maar ook teenstrydig.  Selfs
die gebruik van leestekens is ontoepaslik.  Die bevoegdhede van kuratore
moet spesifiek omlyn word en daar behoort onderskei te word tussen

bevoegdhede wat <n kurator sonder meer kan uitoefen, dié wat met die
Meester se goedkeuring uitgeoefen moet word en daardie wat
hoegenaamd nie toegeken word nie.  Borgstelling behoort nie in die eerste
kategorie te val nie.
[17] Die appèl slaag met koste en die bevel van die hof a quo
word vervang met <n bevel wat -
(a)
verklaar dat die onderneming van 7 Desember 1994 nie ongeldig
is weens die bewerings gemaak in par 8 en 9(a) van die pleit nie;
(b)
die verweerderes gelas word om die koste verbonde aan die aparte
beregting te betaal.

APPèLREGTER
Stem saam:
GROSSKOPF AR
STREICHER AR

MARAIS AR:
[1]          Ek het die voordeel gehad om die uitspraak van Harms AR te
lees.  Ek is dit met hom eens dat die appèl moet slaag maar om ander
redes.  Ek glo nie dat dit op die pleitstukke die hof vrystaan om te bevind
dat die sessie aksessoor t.o.v. die hoofskuld is en nie die borgverpligting
nie.  Appellant (eiser) se saak was juis die teendeel.  In bede (c) het
appellant uitdruklik gevra vir ‘n verklarende bevel “declaring the plaintiff
to be holding as security for the aforesaid claim against the defendant [nie
die hoofskuldenaar nie]  the proceeds standing to the credit of account
number 11994091009 with Saambou Bank and declaring the plaintiff to
be entitled to the proceeds so standing to the credit of such account up to
a maximum of R500 000,00"".  (My beklemtoning.)   As appellant sou
beweer het dat die sessie ter onderskraging van die hoofskuldenaar se
verpligting gegee was, sou respondent dit moontlik betwis het en, indien
nodig, in die alternatief gepleit het dat, as die ooreenkoms anders vertolk
moet word dit nie ‘n juiste weerspieëling van die gemeenskaplike
bedoeling was nie.
[2]          Die bede berus ook, na my mening, op die korrekte vertolking
van die dokument.  Nêrens is daar enigiets daarin te vinde wat sou aandui

dat die sessie nie ter ondersteuning van die borgstelling was nie maar ter
ondersteuning van die hoofskuldenaar se skuld.  Trouens, sonder die
meegaande borgstelling sou dit moeilik gewees het om te konkludeer dat
die sessie nie ‘n uit en uit sessie maar ‘n sessie in securitatem debiti was.
Selfs as die mondelinge getuienis voor die hof a quo as toelaatbaar beskou
word nieteenstaande die afwesigheid van enige eis vir rektifikasie deur die
appellant, is daar geen stawing vir so ‘n bevinding nie.  Dit is nie
verbasend nie want, soos ek voorheen gesê het, was dit nie die appellant
se saak dat die sessie ter ondersteuning van die hoofskuld was nie.  Toe
die appellant se advokaat die appellant se saak geopen het, het hy gesê
“Your Lordship will note, it is a composite document this.  It has two
elements; it has a cession and it has a suretyship.  No doubt the defendant
will contend that it (sic) is inextricably tied up and interdependent.”  Die
respondent se advokaat het op sy beurt die volgende gesê: “In the
plaintiff’s particulars of claim what they claim is firstly ..................
payment of the amount of R500 000,00 which is the amount of the
suretyship, and then in prayer (c) a declarator to the effect that the plaintiff
is holding as security the cession of the investment.  So what plaintiff (my
onderstreping) contends is that they are interrelated and the cession was
done as a security, and the argument of the defendant in that regard would

be that that is specifically excluded by the powers bestowed on the
curatrix in terms of the court order.  She cannot cede anything unless it is
for a valid reason.”  Hy het later gesê:  “If your Lordship finds that the
suretyship was valid, then the matter will continue as to whether there was
any indebtedness, and everything is dependent on the principal debtor’s
indebtedness.  If your Lordship finds that the suretyship is valid (sic - hy
het klaarblyklik “invalid” bedoel) in law, then the defendant contends that
the plaintiff’s claim cannot succeed at all.”  Kort daarna het die hof gesê:
“You say a finding on the validity of the suretyship is simultaneously a
finding on the validity of the cession?”  Die antwoord was: “Yes, and I
would point out to your Lordship that in terms of the powers given to the
curatrix, ............. she cannot pledge anything....................................”
Laasgenoemde verwysing was na die woorde “of vir enige regsgeldige
rede te verpand, of met verband te verswaar” in paragraaf 4 van die
aanhangsel tot die hofbevel.  Daar was daarna geen poging aangewend om
aan te toon dat die sessie nie ter ondersteuning van die borgstelling was
nie of dat dit van die borgstelling skeibaar was nie.
[3]          Ek glo nie dat dit gesê kan word dat die sessie en die
borgstelling volgens algemene beginsels skeibaar is nie.  Geen sodanige
betoog is deur appellant se advokaat geopper nie.  Die blote feit dat die

sessie se ware juridiese kleur (in securitatem debiti) slegs bepaalbaar is
as gevolg van sy koppeling aan die borgstelling is op sigself ‘n sterk
aanduiding dat hulle nie bedoel was om skeibaar te wees nie.
[4]          Nog ‘n aanduiding dat hulle nie selfstandige en skeibare
verpligtings is nie is dat die enigste verwysing in die betrokke dokument
na ‘n beperking van aanspreeklikheid tot die bedrag van R500 000,00 in
die borgstelling gedeelte daarvan(as daar van gedeeltes gepraat kan word)
te vinde is.  As die borgstelling weggedink word, word die sessie nie
alleen ‘n uit en uit sessie nie maar ook ‘n sessie van al die geld wat tot die
krediet van die betrokke rekening mag staan.  Selfs as dit nog steeds as
‘n sessie in securitatem debiti beskou sou kan word, en selfs as aanvaar
kan word dat die sessie ter ondersteuning van die hoofskuld was, as die
bedrag bv R600 000,00 was en as die hoofskuldenaar dieselfde of ‘n
groter bedrag verskuldig was, sou dit volg dat die hele R600 000,00 deur
die skuldeiser aangewend sou kon word ter betaling van die skuld.  Dit
was seer sekerlik nie die bedoeling van die partye nie en dit sou lynreg
met die gewone betekenis van die  betrokke dokument bots.
[5]          Die gevolg hiervan is dat die saak benader moet word op die

grondslag dat, soos deur die hof a quo bevind, die sessie en die
borgstelling nie van mekaar geskei kan word nie en dat, as dit so is dat die
borgstelling ongeldig is, dit moet  volg dat die sessie, as aksessore
verpligting, onafdwingbaar is.  Dit is derhalwe nodig om te beslis of daar
enige ander grondslag is waarop bevind kan word dat die sessie en
borgstelling geldig en afdwingbaar is.
[6]          Uit die aard van die saak kon die hof wat mev Burger as kurator
aangestel het nie die bepalings van art 14 en 15 in gedagte gehad het nie
want daardie bepalings was destyds nie van toepassing op die huwelik
nie. Daar was destyds geen statutêre beperking op die gemeenregtelike
bevoegdheid van die pasiënt om ‘n borgstelling aan te gaan en die
gemeenskaplike boedel daardeur te verbind nie.  Toe die hof besluit het
om die pasiënt se gade as sy kurator aan te stel wel wetend dat hulle binne
gemeenskap van goedere getroud is, moes dit besef het dat, as gevolg van
die aanstelling, mev Burger die enigste persoon sou wees met die
bevoegdheid om namens beide hom en die gemeenskaplike boedel op te
tree.  Gegewe die intieme verhouding tussen haar en die pasiënt, die
mutualiteit van belange, en die praktiese probleme waarvoor sy te staan
sou kom in haar daaglikse lewe indien sy nie vir alle doeleindes met die

bevoegdhede van die pasiënt beklee sou word nie, was dit te verwagte dat
die hof wye magte aan haar sou toestaan.
[7]          Volgens paragraaf 2 van die bevel word mev Burger “aangestel
.......as kurator tot sy persoon en goedere en met die bevoegdheid en
magtiging beklee........... om in die algemeen alle sake met betrekking tot
sy persoon en goedere te behartig, ooreenkomstig die voorskrifte van
aanhangsel ‘A’ ........”.  Sommige van die voorskrifte is deur Harms AR
aangehaal.  As daar gekyk word na die verreikende magte deur die hof
aan mev Burger verleen, is die moeilik om te bevind dat sy nie gemagtig
was om ‘n borgstelling aan te gaan wat die gemeenskaplike boedel sou
verbind nie.   Trouens, as sy nie daardeur gemagtig was om dit te doen
nie, sou daar destyds niemand gewees het wat bevoeg sou wees om dit te
doen nie.  Ek vind dit moeilik om te aanvaar dat dit die hof se bedoeling
was.
[8]          Toe die tersaaklike bepalings van die Wet toepaslik gemaak is
op huwelike binne gemeenskap van goed wat voor die inwerkingtreding
van die Wet  gesluit is, was Mev Burger alreeds deur die hof as kurator
aangestel en gemagtig om haar eggenoot en die gemeenskaplike boedel

ooreenkomstig ‘n  borgstelling te verbind.  Die feit dat die wysiging van
die Wet daarna op hulle van toepassing geword het, het meegebring dat
sy in haar eie reg magte bekom het wat sy nie voorheen gehad het nie,
maar dit het nie die magte deur die hof aan haar verleen toe sy as kurator
aangestel is tot ‘n einde gebring of beperk nie.  Sy het bevoeg geword as
gevolg van art 14 van die Wet om ‘n borgstelling namens haarself aan te
gaan en die gemeenskaplike boedel daardeur te verbind mits sy haar
eggenoot se skriftelike toestemming bekom het.  Sy was alreeds bevoeg
as gevolg van haar aanstelling deur die hof om namens haar eggenoot ‘n
borgstelling aan te gaan en die gemeenskaplike boedel te verbind.  Die
gekombineerde uitwerking van die aanstelling as kurator en die wysiging
van die Wet was in wese om sy en haar eggenoot se juridiese
bevoegdhede in haar te verenig.
[9]          Ek is met Harms AR dit eens dat so ‘n geval nie deur art 15 (2)
geraak is nie.  Die bepaling het betrekking op ‘n situasie waar die gade
wat die betrokke regshandeling wil verrig die toestemming van die ander
gade nodig het en dit nog nie het nie. In hierdie geval was mev Burger
beklee met die bevoegdheid om die regshandelinge te verrig wat sy verrig
het.  Om die redes deur Harms AR uitgestip sou dit absurd wees om

daarop aan te dring dat sy toestemming aan haarself op die formalistiese
wyse in die Wet uiteengesit moet gee voordat sy ‘n party tot ‘n
regsgeldige transaksie kan wees.
[10]         Ek  stem  ook  saam met  Harms  AR  se  opmerkings  i.v.m.
prof de Wet  se  siening  in  sy  oorspronklike  bydrae  in 1 LAWSA par
107 dat “a contract  can  only  come  into  being  by  agreement  between
at  least  two persons”.
[11]          Na my mening moet die appèl slaag met koste en die bevel van
die hof a quo  vervang word met die volgende bevel:
“(a)
It is declared that the cession in securitatem debiti
and the suretyship obligation contained in the
undertaking of 7 December 1994 are valid in law and
binding upon the joint estate;
(b)
Defendant is ordered to pay the costs attributable to
the separate hearing of specific issues.”

VAN HEERDEN AHR
Ek gaan akkoord met die siening van Harms AR dat, op ‘n uitleg
van die tersaaklike dokument, die sessie nie aksessoor tot die respondent
se borgverpligting is nie.  Ek twyfel egter of so ‘n konstruksie behoorlik
in die pleitstukke geopper of in geskil gestel is.  Aangesien ek saamstem
met die mening van Marais AR dat die borgstelling geldig is, is dit egter
onnodig om verder op hierdie aspek in te gaan .
Ek stem dus ook saam met die bevele wat Marais AR in die
vooruitsig stel.

HEFER JA
[1]      Within the bounds of any anti-avoidance provisions in the
relevant legislation, a taxpayer may minimise his tax liability by
arranging his affairs in a suitable manner.   If eg the same commercial
result can be achieved in different ways, he may enter into the type of
transaction which does not attract tax or attracts less tax.   But, when it
comes to considering whether by doing so he has succeeded in
avoiding or reducing the tax, the court will give effect to the true nature
and substance of the transaction and will not be deceived by its form.
(Erf 3183/1 Ladysmith (Pty) Ltd and Another v Commissioner for
Inland Revenue 1996(3) SA 942 (A) at 950I-952C.)
[2]      At issue in the present case is the true nature and substance of
two sets of agreements between the taxpayer (ATycon@) and Firstcorp
Merchant Bank Ltd (AFirstcorp@).   In form each set comprises a sale
and leaseback of some of Tycon=s manufacturing plant and
equipment.   The Commissioner=s contention is that the agreements
are not what they purport to be.   The  dispute arose when Tycon
sought to deduct the rentals paid in terms of the leasebacks as
expenditure in the production of income under  s 11(a) of the Income
Tax Act 58 of 1962, as amended.   When the Commissioner refused to

allow the deductions and in addition invoked s 103 of the Act, Tycon
appealed  to a Special Court.   The appeal succeeded  and the matter
was remitted to the Commissioner for re-assessment on the basis that
the rentals were deductible.  With the necessary leave the
Commissioner has now appealed directly to this Court.   The first issue
is the true nature and substance of the agreements.   In the event of a
finding that they are indeed what they purport to be as the Special
Court found, a further question will be whether the Commissioner
correctly invoked s 103.

The true nature of the agreements

[3]      In broad terms the Commissioner=s contention is that, despite
the form of the agreements, Tycon did not sell and lease back its
equipment, but in substance borrowed the Apurchase price@ from
Firstcorp.   Both in the Special Court and in this Court his counsel
expressly accepted that the parties did not act in fraudem legis by
deliberately disguising their transactions.   In the written heads of
argument the agreements came under attack solely for lack of what
was apparently regarded as essential elements of a sale (cf McAdams
v Fiander=s Trustee & Bell NO 1919 AD 207 at 223-224).   On this
basis it was submitted that there was no agreement on a verum

pretium nor an intention to transfer and acquire ownership.   At the
commencement of his oral argument Mr Rubens for the Commissioner
indicated that he would not press the argument relating to the price.
When it was pointed out to him that the only remaining point would
then be that the parties did not intend ownership to pass and that the
passing of ownership is not an essential element of a sale, he
informed us that he would argue that the agreements should not be
applied according to their tenor because, although Tycon and
Firstcorp might honestly have believed that it would be sufficient
to go through the formality of concluding that kind of agreement
in order to procure tax benefits for themselves, they had no real
intention to enter into agreements of sale and leaseback.
Argument then proceeded on this basis.
[4]      Despite the reference to the parties= honest belief, it seems to
me that the logical effect of the submission is precisely what the
Commissioner has constantly been disavowing, viz that they
dishonestly concealed the true nature of their transactions.   Certain
dicta in cases like McAdams v Fiander=s Trustee & Bell NO supra,
Goldinger=s Trustee v Whitelaw & Son 1917 AD 66, Bank Windhoek
Bpk v Rajie en `n Ander 1994(1) SA 115 (A) (the minority judgment)
and Nedcor Bank Ltd v Absa Ltd 1998(2) SA 830 (W) support the

proposition that the true nature of a transaction will prevail where the
parties enter into an agreement in the honest belief that they will
achieve a particular purpose by doing so, but do not actually intend it
to have effect according to its tenor. In McAdams eg the real
transaction was found to be a loan even though the parties had
deliberately cast their agreement in the form of a sale in the bona fide
belief that it would provide security to the Apurchaser@.   But even in
such a case the agreement is plainly a simulation;  and it may be a
dishonest simulation depending on what use the parties want to make
of it.   In  the present case Tycon required capital to expand its
business.   Firstcorp was prepared to make the funds available. Both
parties were aware of the tax benefits to be gained from sales and
leasebacks and decided to follow that course.   If they did not
genuinely intend ownership of the merx to pass upon signature of the
agreement  as each agreement of sale stipulated, the agreements
would have been simulations and could only have been signed with
the object of deceiving the Commissioner.   The conclusion that this
would indeed be a case of  fraus legis cannot be avoided.
[5]      This is not the only problem that I have with the submission.
Although Mr Rubens assured us that the Commissioner=s case was
conducted on the same basis in the Special Court, he candidly

confessed that he never suggested in his cross-examination of
Tycon=s witnesses that the agreements  had been signed under the
impression that the mere formality would be sufficient, or that the
actual intention was that the agreements would not have effect
according to their tenor.  The record leaves one with the firm
impression that the cross-examination of Tycon=s witnesses turned on
the effect of the agreements rather than on the signatories= actual
intentions.   Tycon=s case might well have been conducted differently
had the argument in this Court been raised in the Special Court and in
fairness we should really decline to entertain what is essentially a new
point.
[6]      I will nevertheless deal with the argument because I am of the
view that it is in any event not supported by the facts.   In view of the
analysis of the evidence and the submissions for the Commissioner in
the Special Court=s reported judgment (ITC 1636 in 60 (1998) SATC
267) only a brief discussion is required.
[7]      The Special Court found (on the strength of the presumption in s
82 of the Act) that the onus was on Tycon to prove the authenticity of
the agreements and that the onus had been discharged.   The
signatory on Tycon=s behalf and two Firstcorp officials who had
negotiated the transactions testified that the parties intended to give

effect to the transactions according to their terms.   The Special Court
accepted their evidence on the point.
[8]      The Court=s judgment was vigorously criticized in the written
heads of argument for the Commissioner.   In some respects the
criticism is valid;  in others not; and in still others it is no longer
relevant in view of the limited scope of the argument.   It is not
necessary to go into the details because it is quite clear to me that Mr
Rubens is clutching at straws.   The real point of his submission is that
neither Tycon nor Firstcorp actually intended to enter into agreements
of sale and leaseback.   One way of testing its validity is to ask: If the
parties did not intend to deceive, how did it come about that they
entered into agreements which they knew would have no effect inter
se as sales and leasebacks?   The problem facing the Commissioner
is that he has discarded the possibility that the agreements were
deliberately disguised.   The only other  explanation which he is able
to suggest is that the parties might have believed that the formal
instruments would gain them the desired tax benefits.   But this is
sheer speculation which finds no support in the evidence and is
against the probabilities.   I say this particularly in view of

the consideration which Tycon=s staff and financial director
in consultation with the financial directors of affiliated

companies gave to the advantages and disadvantages of
sales and leasebacks;

the fact that the disadvantage which the  loss of the
ownership of part of Tycon=s plant would bring about, was
expressly mentioned and considered;

the fact that offers by other banks to make funds available
by way of sales and leasebacks were received and
considered by the company;

the extensive negotiations which were conducted at arms
length with Firstcorp; and

the expertise of the people involved in the negotiations
and the signing of the agreements.
All this goes to show that the parties were not merely going through
the motions of concluding agreements.   And if they were not, the very
foundation of the submission crumbles.
[9]      The fact of the matter is that the evidence that the parties had
every intention of entering into agreements of sale and leaseback and
of putting the agreements into effect was not contradicted.   The result
was that the Special Court had no option but to accept it unless the
witnesses were not reliable, or all the available information and such
inferences as might justifiably be drawn, were cogent enough to cast

sufficient doubt thereon.  I have not been persuaded that the Court
erred in finding the witnesses reliable;  or that there is sufficient reason
to doubt the authenticity of the agreements.   Mr Rubens referred us to
certain provisions of the agreements which, he submitted, are not
usually found in agreements of sale and agreements of lease and
militate against an intention to buy and sell and to lease back.   But it
is by no means unusual to find provisions in a sale and leaseback
which do not typically appear in a contract of purchase and sale or in a
contract of lease.   On the contrary, as Professor Nereus Joubert
points out in AAsset-based financing, contracts of purchase and sale,
and simulated transactions@ 109 (1992) SALJ 707 at 708,
A[d]espite the fact that new asset-based financing transactions are
often carefully drafted to reflect contracts of purchase and sale or
contracts of letting and hiring, they almost invariably contain
provisions which are not typically found in such types of
contract ...@ (Emphasis added.)

Moreover, although  a sale and leaseback comprises an agreement of
sale as well as an agreement of lease, it must be treated as one
composite transaction.   This is why Mr Rubens=s reliance on the fact
that Tycon could not do without the equipment sold to Firstcorp
because it was in daily use in Tycon=s factory, is misplaced.   If we
were to look at the agreement of sale separately this would be a valid

point, but, viewed in the context of the whole transaction, the
argument loses its sting:  as lessee Tycon would be assured of the
use of the equipment for the duration of the lease.   It is really the
provisions dealing with their fate at the end of the lease that count.   In
this regard Mr Rubens stressed clause 5 of the each lease.   It is to
the effect that the equipment would on the expiry date remain
Firstcorp=s property.    But there is also clause 10 which grants Tycon
the option to renew the lease on that date and annually thereafter.   In
effect the company was entitled to the indefinite use of the equipment.
Admittedly it lost its ownership.   But this was a considered and
accepted disadvantage for which the capital generated by the
transactions more than compensated.   All in all the transactions made
perfectly good business sense.
[10]      In my view the Special Court was correct in deciding the first
issue in Tycon=s favour.

Did the Commissioner correctly invoke s 103?
[11]      Although s  103 was no doubt designed to enable the
Commissioner to deal effectively with tax avoidance schemes, it
operates only in the circumstances stipulated in the section itself.   As
Watermeyer CJ observed in Commissioner for Inland Revenue v IHB

King 1947(2) SA 196 (A) at 209,
Aif a transaction is covered by the terms of the section its provisions
come into operation, if it is not then its provisions cannot be
applied.@

Broadly speaking the section empowers the Commissioner  to
determine a taxpayer=s liability for income tax and other taxes by
disregarding any abnormal transaction which the latter has entered
into for the purpose of avoiding or postponing his tax liability or
reducing the amount thereof.   I need not list all the requirements that
must co-exist before the power may be exercised because we are only
concerned with the abnormality requirement and the purpose
requirement.   A transaction is regarded as abnormal if it was entered
into or carried out by means or in a manner which would not normally
be employed in the entering into or carrying out of a transaction of the
nature of the transaction in question;  or has created rights or
obligations which would not normally be created between persons
dealing at arms length under a transaction of the nature of the
transaction in question.   An abnormal transaction may be disregarded
if  it was entered into or carried out solely or mainly for the purposes
of the avoidance or the postponement of liability for the payment of
any tax or the reduction of the amount of such liability.
[12]      From the judgment in Secretary for Inland Revenue v Geustyn,

Forsyth & Joubert 1971(3) SA 567 (A) at 571E-H and other reported
judgments of this Court the following emerges:
(a)
Although the Commissioner may invoke the section whenever
he is satisfied of the presence of its requirements, a Special
Court may re-hear the whole case and, if necessary, substitute
its own decision for that of the Commissioner.   When Geustyn
was decided appeals against decisions of Special Courts were
limited to questions of law.  The Act has since been amended to
do away with this  limitation and this Court may now exercise the
same powers as a Special Court.
(b)
The effect, purpose and normality of a transaction are
essentially questions of fact.   The onus is on the Commissioner
to prove that its effect was to avoid or postpone the liability for
tax or to reduce the amount thereof.   Upon proof that this was
the case it is presumed (in terms of ss (4)) that the effect of the
transaction was also its sole or main purpose.
(c)
What has to be determined in every case is the subjective
purpose of the taxpayer.
[13]      In the present case the Special Court found that the
Commissioner had not established the abnormality of the sales and
leasebacks and that Tycon had established the absence of the

purpose requirement.   Both findings were attacked in this Court, but a
decision in Tycon=s favour on either will dispose of the appeal.   I
proceed to deal with the purpose of the transactions.
[14]      The enquiry is limited to a single question. I have already
mentioned that Firstcorp was prepared to make the capital available
which Tycon needed to expand its business.   The financing could be
structured either as a loan or as a sale and leaseback;  but from an
income tax point of view the latter was preferable and mainly for this
reason Tycon decided on a sale and leaseback.   The Commissioner=s
contention is that this is all that counts;  the sole purpose of the
transaction was to reduce the company=s tax liability;  and it matters
not that Tycon needed the capital to finance its expansion programme.
Tycon=s argument is precisely the opposite:  the purpose of the whole
exercise was to obtain capital, not to reduce tax;  and if the reduction
of its tax liability can be regarded as a purpose of the transactions as
envisaged in s 103 at all, it was not the main purpose.
[15]      I share the Special Court=s view that the agreements of sale
and leaseback served the dual purpose of providing Tycon with capital
and to take advantage of the tax benefits to be derived from that type
of transaction. The following passage in the Court=s judgment (at 393)
neatly describes the situation:

A[The raising of finance] was the fons et origo of the transactions
and it remained the underlying and basic purpose thereof ... This
whole arrangement ... was to achieve the predominant purpose of
raising finance but, because of the welcome by-product of the tax
benefit, the vehicles chosen were the sale and leaseback
transactions.@

It is submitted on behalf of the Commissioner that the only reason why
sales and leasebacks were preferred to a straightforward loan was
that a loan would not bring about such advantageous tax deductions.
This is not entirely correct because there were other commercial
reasons too.   But, even if the particular type of transaction was
chosen solely for the tax benefits, it would be wrong to ignore the fact
that, had Tycon not needed capital, there would not have been any
transaction at all.   Tycon did not approach Firstcorp in order to
alleviate its tax burden;  it did so because it was in need of capital and
this plainly remained the main purpose of the transactions.   It is not
necessary to deal with the case of Commissioner of Taxation of the
Commonwealth of Australia v Spotless Services Limited [1996] 186
CLR 404 on which the Commissioner relies because it is clearly
distinguishable both on the facts and in respect of the applicable
legislation.
[16]      In view of this conclusion it is not necessary to deal with the
Special Court=s finding that the abnormality of the transactions had not

been established.   Suffice it to say that what the Commissioner had to
establish, was the abnormality of the transactions as sales and
leasebacks.   To decide whether he had done so, the Court rightly
took all the circumstances of the case into account and did not content
itself with an examination of the typicality of the terms of the
agreements.
[17]      I conclude therefore that the Special Court correctly found in
Tycon=s favour on the second issue as well.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs including
the costs of two counsel.

Heard:

Delivered: 10 September 1999
Summary:  A mortgagee’s power to increase the rate of interest
JUDGMENT

-2-
VAN HEERDEN DCJ:
[1] There is one cardinal question which falls to be answered in all three
appeals before us.  It is whether a clause in a mortgage bond conferring upon
the mortgagee the right to unilaterally  increase the original rate of interest
payable by the mortgagor is valid.  If so, appeal (1) must succeed and appeal
(2) be dismissed, whilst a further point will  have to be considered in appeal
(3). [For convenience I have in the heading numbered the appeals (1), (2) and
(3).]
[2] Appeal (1) is against a decision of  Southwood J  in the  Witwatersrand
Local Division (reported in 1998 (3) SA 765 (W).  He held that the clause in
question conferred upon the mortgagee an unfettered power to vary the
interest rate.  He concluded that the clause was invalid because a term of a
contract leaving  it to the will of one of the parties to determine the extent of his
or the other party’s presentation is void for vagueness.  For these reasons  he

-3-
made an order declaring that the clause was invalid and unenforceable.
[3] The appellant in appeal (2) appeals against a decision of Thirion J in the
Natal Provincial Division (reported in 1999 (2) SA 656(N)).  He held that it was
an implied term of the clause under discussion that the mortgagee
“...would be entitled to raise the rate of interest agreed upon in clause
3 of the mortgage bond whenever and to the extent that it would, in
the usual and ordinary course of its business as a financial institution,
and as a result of a general increase in interest rates in the market,
raise the interest rate charged by it on new mortgage loans of the
same nature and category as the one to which the loan in question
belongs - provided always that such increased rate of interest would
not exceed the maximum permissible under the Usury Act “ (at 665B-
D).
[4] Since in his view it was not possible to decide whether the increased
mortgage rates in that case conformed with his basic finding, the matter was
postponed sine die so as to allow the parties an opportunity to adduce
evidence.
[5] In the court below in appeal (3) Gihwala AJ held in the Cape Provincial
Division that the mortgagee’s power was not unfettered sine he could increase

-4-
the interest rate only in accordance with prevailing banking practices.  He
furthermore rejected separate defences raised by the present appellant in
appeal (3) and granted summary judgment against her (The decision has been
reported in 1999(2) SA 456 (C).)
[6] The matter is not res nova .  In Boland Bank v Steele 1994 (1) SA 259
(T) 276 Van Dijkhorst J held in the Transvaal Provincial Division that the
clause must be construed as conferring upon the mortgagee a power to be
exercised in a reasonable way, and that it was therefore valid.  A different
approach was adopted by Stegman J in the Witwatersrand Local Division.  In
NBS Bank Ltd v Badenhorst-Schnetler Bedryfsdienste BK 1998 (3) SA 729
(W) 736 he found that in a moneylending contract the rate of interest payable
by the lender is one of the essentials of the contract which must be rendered
certain by the parties’ agreement.  If not the contract is void for vagueness.
In the result he concluded that the clause was null and void.

-5-
[7] For present purposes there does not appear to be any difference
between the clause under consideration and a clause in an overdraft
agreement conferring upon a banker the right to increase the rate of interest
payable on the amount of the overdraft.  In Nedbank Ltd v Capital Refrigerated
Truck Bodies (Pty) Ltd 1988 (4) SA 73 (N) 74 Milne JP had to consider the
validity or otherwise of such an overdraft agreement.  He found that it was
valid either because an obligation to pay interest is not one of the essentialia
of a contract of loan or because the bank’s power had to be exercised arbitrio
boni viri.  A similar conclusion was reached by Wunsh J in Investec Bank (Pty)
Ltd v GVN Properties CC 1999 (3) SA 490 (W) 499 F-H.  His view was that
interest rate variations have to conform with the rate charged to a borrower in
the same category to whom loans of the same type are made, and that the
clause did not confer upon the bank an unqualified right to act capriciously or
unreasonably.   For these reasons he concluded that the above mentioned
judgments of Stegman J and Southwood J were clearly wrong.

-6-
[8] (For another analogous case which tends to support a contention that
the clause in question is enforceable, see Diners Club SA (Pty) Ltd v Thorburn
1990 (2) SA 870 (C) ).
[9] A recurring theme in those cases in which it was held that the clause in
question is invalid, is that a contract which empowers one of the parties to fix
a prestation is void for vagueness.  With one exception that was undoubtedly
the view of Roman Dutch Law writers in regard to the determination of the
price in a sale and the rental in a lease.  However, in Benlou Properties (Pty)
Ltd v Vector Graphics (Pty) Ltd 1993 (1) SA 179 (A)185-6 two  observations
were  made  thereanent.    The first was that the reason  given  by  our  writers
for  their  views, viz  that  the  price  or  rental is  uncertain,  is difficult  to
reconcile  with  their  recognition  that  it  may  validly  be  left  to  the
determination  of  a  third  party.    In  such a  case  the  price  or  rental  is
after  all  as  “uncertain”  as  when  such  a prestation is to be determined by

-7-
one of the parties.   I may add that if A sells to B any one of his hundred
horses the merx remains uncertain until it is determined by either the seller or
the buyer, as the case may be.  Yet it is undoubtedly a valid contract.
[10] The second was that the views of Voet and others did not accord with
modern legal systems.  Something more should be said about those systems
as well as English and Scottish law to which no or little reference was made
in Benlou.
[11] In May and Butcher Ltd v R [1929] All ER Rep 679 (HL) 684 D, Viscount
Dunedin said that “it is a perfectly good contract to say that the price is to be
settled by the buyer”.  This dictum was followed in Lombard Tricity Finance Ltd
v Paton [1989] 1 All ER 918 (CA) 923 g,  a case very much in point. A
consumer credit agreement provided that the lender could increase the rate
of interest in his absolute discretion.  The Court of Appeal found that this
stipulation was valid.
[12] Scottish institutional writers also hold that a term in a contract of sale

-8-
empowering either party to determine the price is unobjectionable.  Of
particular significance  is the  following  passage in Brown, Treatise on the
Law of Sale p 150:
“204.  Another question upon which some doubt has existed, is,
whether the price may lawfully be left to be fixed by one of the parties
to the sale.  Pothier holds that it cannot, (Contr. De Vente, No 23.;)
and it seems to be the common opinion, that such was the rule of the
Roman law, Vinn. ad Inst. 3.24. p. 612. § 3.: Voet. ad Pand. 18.1.§
23.: Huber, tom.l. p. 320. § 6.: Ersk. 3.3.4.  One commentator, (Noodt,
ad lib. 18. Tit. 1 T. tom. 2. p. 388) however, maintains that such a
reference was lawful and competent by the Roman law; not, indeed,
to the effect of enabling the party to whom the price was referred, to
fix it absolutely, and without its being possible to have it corrected in
case of obvious iniquity, but to the effect of enabling him to fix a price
secundum arbitrium boni viri, leaving it open to the judge to interfere
for the correction of his estimate, if it were  unjust.
The latter rule, together also with the qualification annexed to
it, seems to be adopted in our law, (Ersk. 3.3.4.: Stair, 131.) and in
one case was expressly admitted”.
See also Stair, Institutions, pp 188-9; Erskine, Institute, pp 725-6,  May and
Butcher Ltd, supra, at 684 E, and Steven v Robertson (1760) M 3158.
[13] In German Law the position is governed by para 315 of the BGB.  It

-9-
provides that if a prestation is to be determined by one of the parties it is, in
case of doubt, to be accepted that an equitable discretion must be exercised.
If an inequitable determination is made, it can be assailed by the other party:
Palandt, Bürgerliches Gezetzbuch, 42nd ed, pp 355-7; Larenz, Lehrbuch des
Schuldrechts, 12th ed, vol 1 pp 67-70.  An identical position obtains in Swiss
law: Von Tuhr, Allgemeiner Teil des Schweizerischen Obligationenrechts 3rd
ed, vol 1, p 191.
[14] The test in Dutch Law is somewhat different.  If the parties left it to one
of them or a third party to determine a prestation, the agreement is perfectly
valid but a determination can be assailed if it is inequitable or unreasonable.
See Asser-Hartkamp, Verbintenissenrecht, 10th ed, part 1, p 18, and part 2,
p.314.  In such a case the determination is voidable at the instance of the
other party.
[15] In the United States section 2-305 (2) of the Uniform Commercial Code
provides that a price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer “means a price

-10-
for him to fix in good faith”.
[16] It will thus be seen that the views of our writers that a sale or lease
containing a power to fix the price or rental is not only illogical but also sadly
out of step with modern legal systems.  It is problematical whether we should
still follow those rules, and I shall revert to this question.  For present purposes
it is, however, unnecessary to decide the point.  This is so because the above
views were not articulated in respect of a contractual power to fix a prestation
other than a price or rental, and there is ample reason not to extend the
common law rule to other types of contractual discretions, and therefor not e.g.
to a discretionary power provided for in a contract of loan.
[17] There is an additional reason for holding that the clause under
discussion is valid.  Even if , contrary to my above view, there should be an
analogous extension of the common law rule, that rule concerned one of the
essentialia of a sale or lease, and I am not aware of an extension of that rule
to other terms of such contracts, and a fortiori not to terms of other types of
contracts.  And although in the Western world the erstwhile Catholic

-11-
prohibition of the charging of interest, so fiercely defended by the Jesuits, no
longer obtains, a term relating to the payment of interest is not an essentialé,
as opposed to a material term, of a contract of loan.   There can after all  be
a  perfectly good  contract of loan even if it makes  no  provision for the
payment of interest.  I  am not  unmindful  of the  fact that  according  to Lubbe,
Kontraktuele
diskresies,
potestatiewe
voorwaardes
en
die
bepaalheidsvereiste, 1989 TSAR 159,173, no distinction should be drawn, for
present purposes, between an essentialé and another term of a contract, but
he gives no reasons for his opinion.  And see Davids, Unilaterally imposed
terms in Contract, 1965 SALJ 108,110.
[18] It has already appeared that in NBS Bank Ltd Stegmann J typified a
term in a loan relating to the payment of interest as an essential term of the
contract.  It is not clear to me whether Stegmann J intended to say that such
a term is an essentialé, as distinguished from a material term,  of a loan.  If he
did, he was clearly wrong.
[19] Is there any decision of this court which stands in the way of my above

-12-
approitach?  In Murray and Roberts Construction Ltd v Finat Properties  (Pty)
Ltd 1991 (1) SA 508 (A), 514  Hoexter JA said:
“It is no doubt a general principle of the law of obligations that, when
it depends entirely on the will of a party to an alleged contract to
determine the extent of the prestation of either party, the purported
contract is void  for vagueness. Obvious examples of the application
of the principles are afforded by the law of sale. If, for example, it is left
to one of the parties  to fix the price the contract is bad.”
Not only was no authority cited in support of this broad statement but it was
clearly an obiter dictum.
[20] In Patel v Adam 1977 (2) SA 653 (A) 666 this court considered an
agreement of sale in terms of which it was left to the purchaser to determine
what amount he wished to pay each month as an instalment of the purchase
price.  It was held that the sale was void for uncertainty.  It should be observed,
however, that the sale also did not provide for a period during which the full
purchase price had to be paid.  Hence, this was a clear case of a condicio si
voluero (to which further reference is made below).  In any event, the power of
the purchaser related to the fixing of components of a purchase price.
[21] At first blush a more formidable obstacle is created by a passage in the

-13-
judgment of Van den Heever JA in Theron NO v Joynt 1951(1) SA 498 (A) 506.
It reads:
“Waar een van twee mense, wat voorgee kontrakterende partye te
wees, hom die reg voorbehou om na willekeur enige beding in die
sogenaamde ooreenkoms eensydig te wysig, kom sy resposisie in alle
opsigte ooreen met dié van iemand wat oënskynlik ‘n verpligting
aangaan op voorwaarde dat hy na willekeur daardie verpligting kan
nakom of ontduik.  Sulke handelinge beskou ons reg as geen
regshandelinge nie of handelinge sonder regsgevolge (D. 45.1.17;
45.1.46.3; 45.1.108.1).”
[22] It is not clear to me what was meant by the use of the word “willekeurig”.
But even if the learned judge intended to refer to a discretionary power two
observations should be made.  The first is that the quoted passage was also
an obiter dictum since nothing turned on it.  The second is that the dictum is,
with respect, not borne out by the Digest texts upon which Van den Heever JA
relied.  They read as follows (Mommsen, Krueger and Watson, The Digest of
Justinianus, vol iv pp 652, 657 and 667):

-14-
D45.1.17
“A stipulation is not valid when a condition is entrusted to the
judgment of the party making the promise”
D 45.1.46.3
“However, the stipulation ‘do you promise to give, if you wish’, is
clearly invalid”.
D 45.1.108.1
“No promise can be valid if it lies wholly within the choice of the
promissor”.
[23] It is clear, I think that all three texts relate to the validity of a condicio si
voluero, i.e. a condition that the promissor is bound to perform only should he
wish to do so.  At most they concern a contract or stipulation where the
promissor may determine his own prestation, and do not deal with the situation
where the other party has the right to determine or alter the promissor’s
obligation.

-15-
[24] In sum I am of the view that, save, perhaps, where a party is given the
power to fix his own prestation, or to fix a purchase price or rental, a stipulation
conferring upon a contractual party the right to determine a prestation is
unobjectionable.  Second, and has been said above,  there is an additional
reason for holding that the clause under discussion is valid.  Of course, in
some cases providing for discretional determinations there may be no
enforceable contract until the determination is made.  But when made an
unconditional contract comes into being.
[25] All this does not mean that an exercise of such a contractual discretions
is necessarily unassailable.  It may be voidable at the instance of the other
party.  It is, I think, a rule of our common law that unless a contractual
discretionary power was clearly intended to be completely unfettered, an
exercise of such a discretion must be made arbitrio bono viri (cf  Dharumpal
Transport (Pty) Ltd v Dharumpal  1956 (1) SA 700 (A)  707 A-B;   Moe Bros v
White 1925 AD 71,77;  Holmes v Goodall and Williams Ltd  1936 CPD 35,40;

-16-
Belville-Inry (Edms) Bpk v Continental China (Pty) Ltd 1976 (3) SA 583 (C) 591
G-H,  and Remini v Basson 1993 (3) SA 204 (N) 210 I-J).   In his commentary
on the Digest Windscheid, Lehrburch des Pandektenrechts, 7th ed, vol 2 p 407,
maintains that such a rule existed in Roman Law.  He relies inter alia on D
50.17.22 which certainly appears to provide analogous support for his view.
It reads (the same translation):
“One must in general approve of the principle that wherever in actions
of good faith the condition of someone is placed in the power of his
master or of his procurator, then this power is to be regarded as
equivalent to the power of the decision of a good man”.
[26] Reference may also be made to D.17.2.77 where it is said that where
one party has to do work to the satisfaction of the other party, the latter must
exercise his discretion arbitrium bono vire.
[27] The discretionary powers vested in the mortgagees by the relevant
deeds must therefore be subject to this inherent limitation.  The attack made
on behalf of the mortgagors concerned effectively assumes that there is no

-17-
such limitation. It is an erroneous assumption.
[28] So far I have confined myself to our common law and  comparable  legal
systems.  An analogous  conclusion may  well be  reached if  one applies the
modern concept of the role of public policy, bona fides and contractual equity
to the question in issue (see e.g. Eerste Nasionale Bank van Suidelike Afrika
Bpk v Saayman NO 1997 (4) SA 302 (SCA) 318-31, per Olivier JA.)
[29] The question whether in cases such as these appeals a determination
does not comply with the above requirement if it is merely unjust, or whether
it must be manifestly unjust, need not be answered (cf Voet 18.1.23 and
Gane’s note (h) in vol 3, p 278, in regard to the determination of a price by a
third party).  The reason is that none of the mortgagors attempted to assail the
fixing of increased interest rates.  They relied solely on the contention that the
clause was invalid.  At the risk of repetition I should again say that the clause
is perfectly valid, but that an exercise of the power conferred upon the
mortgagor may be objectionable.

-18-
[30] One further point should be made.  It is conceivable, albeit unlikely, that
a stipulation may be so worded that an absolute discretion to  fix a prestation
is conferred on one of the parties.  Here again it is unnecessary to express a
view as to whether such a stipulation will be invalid, as being in conflict with
public policy, or whether the fixing of the prestation  may only be assailed when
it is done in bad faith.
[31] In conclusion I should mention that the provisions of the Usury Act 73 of
1968 have no bearing on the outcome of the three appeals.
[32] I revert to a stipulation which confers on one of the parties the power to
fix the purchase price or rental, as the case may be.  In the light of what has
already been said there does not appear to be any logical rationale for drawing
a distinction, in the context under consideration, between such a stipulation and
other similar stipulations conferring on a party to a contract a discretion to
determine a prestation.  The exercise of the power to determine the price or
rental would after all be open to attack on the same grounds as in the case of

-19-
utilization of other types of discretionary stipulations.  However, the common
law rule governing sales and leases was not in issue in this court, and the
question whether the rule should be jettisoned was not argued before us.
Hence, it is unnecessary, and indeed undesirable, to decide that question.
[33] I now  turn to  an additional point raised by  the  appellant  in appeal (3).
In her affidavit resisting the application for summary judgment she alleged that
the present respondent had previously obtained judgment by default against
her;  that this had occurred in conflict with an arrangement between the parties
that pending settlement negotiations it would not be necessary for her to enter
an appearance to defend, and that she resultantly suffered damages  under
various  headings.    She  went on to say that she would  claim the damages
either by way of a counterclaim in the respondent’s action against her or by
instituting a separate action.
[34] For various reasons her affidavit does not disclose a genuine defence.
I mention only two .  The first is that a claim for damages can only be a

-20-
”defence” if the court is asked to stay judgment on the plaintiffs claim until the
defendant has established a counter claim.  As has appeared, this is not what
the appellant did in casu .  Indeed, she indicated that she might prefer her
claim in a separate action.
[35] Second, the appellant in essence did no more than make the bald
allegations that her credit-worthiness and rights of personality had been
infringed because judgment by default had been given against her.  She
studiously refrained from giving factual details to support her allegations, and
certainly did not comply with the requirements of Rule 32(3) (b) of the Uniform
Rules  that an affidavit resisting a claim for summary judgment disclose fully
the material facts relied upon by a defendant.
[36] The following orders are made:
(1) Appeal (1) is allowed with costs, including the costs of two counsel, and the
following is substituted for the order of the court a quo:

-21-
“(a) It is declared that clause 14 of mortgage bonds 36200/95 and
68231/95 is valid.
(b) The defendants are ordered jointly and severally to pay the
plaintiff’s costs, including the costs of two counsel”.
(2)
Appeals (2) and (3) are dismissed with costs, including the costs of two
counsel.

Income tax - sec 11(a) and 23(g) of Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 - close

to owner by corporation deductible.
J U D G M E N T
Hefer JA

[1]    This appeal is against the judgment in Commissioner for Inland
Revenue v Ticktin Timbers CC 1997(3) SA 625 (C) in which the full
court of the Cape Provincial Division upheld the Commissioner’s
refusal to allow the appellant, a close corporation, to deduct  interest on
capital borrowed from its only member from its income for the purpose
of determining its taxable income during the 1985 to 1989 years of
assessment.   What has to be decided is whether the full court’s finding
that the interest did not constitute expenditure incurred in the
production of the corporation’s income as envisaged in s 11(a) of the
Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, as amended, is correct.
[2]      The general deduction formula of the Act and its precursors has
received the attention of the courts on many occasions and, although
problems arising from its application in particular cases still present
themselves, its ambit is well-defined.   For present purposes it suffices
to record the following:
(a)
S 11(a) which allows the deduction of non-capital
“expenditure ... actually incurred ... in the production of the
income” is subject to s  23(g) which (before its amendment
during 1992) prohibited the deduction of moneys “not
wholly or exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes

of trade”.
The combined effect of the two sections is that
“[i]f expenditure is incurred ‘in the production of
income’ and ‘wholly and exclusively for the purpose of
trade’ it is deductible, otherwise not.”
(Per Watermeyer AJP in Port Elizabeth Electric Tramway
Co v Commissioner for Inland Revenue 1936 CPD 241 at
245.)   The enquiry must accordingly proceed by
examining, on the facts of each case, firstly, whether the
expenditure in question can be classified as expenditure
actually incurred in the production of income and, secondly,
whether its deduction is prohibited by s 23(g)
(Commissioner for Inland Revenue v Nemojim 1983(4) SA
936 (A) at 947A).
(b)
The purpose for which the expenditure was incurred is the
decisive consideration in the application of s 23(g).   As far
as s 11(a) is concerned, Corbett JA said in Commissioner
for Inland Revenue v Standard Bank of SA Ltd 1985(4) SA
485 (A) at 500H-J:
“Generally, in deciding whether money outlayed by a
taxpayer constitutes expenditure incurred in the
production of income (in terms of the general
deduction
formula)
important
and
sometimes
overriding factors are the purpose of the expenditure

and what the expenditure actually effects;  and in this
regard the closeness of the connection between the
expenditure and the income-earning operations must
be assessed.”
(c)
There can be no objection in principle to the deduction of
interest on loans in suitable cases.   Loan capital is the life
blood of many businesses but the mere frequency of its
occurrence does not bring about that this type of
expenditure requires different treatment.   (Cf the Standard
Bank case and Natal Laeveld Boerdery (Edms) Bpk v
Kommissaris van Binnelandse Inkomste 1989(1) SA 639
(A).)
[3]      The interest which concerns us in the present case was credited
annually on the accumulated balance in the loan account of the
corporation’s member, Dr David Ticktin.   The sole issue is the purpose
for which the loan was made.   In order to decide it, it  is necessary to
deal briefly with the facts.
[4]      The appellant came into being during 1985 when Dr Ticktin
acquired the shares in a private company and converted the company
into a close corporation.   Among the company’s assets was a
substantial amount of distributable reserves which, in terms of s 40A of
the Act (as it then read), were deemed to have been distributed to the

corporation.   In the first entry in the loan account the balance of the
reserves after tax was credited to Dr Ticktin.  Thereafter the
corporation’s net income until 30 June 1985 was also credited to him;
and so was its net trading income for every ensuing year until 1989. Dr
Ticktin’s explanation is to the effect that, as sole member of the
corporation, he was entitled to whatever dividends he wished to
declare; and that all the credits were passed in respect of dividends
which he had declared but retained in the business as an interest
bearing loan in order to finance its day to day operations.
[5]      It is quite clear that it was of Dr Ticktin’s own doing that the
appellant was in effect compelled to exist on borrowed capital.   There
was no obvious need for the diversion of money which had accrued to
it and could have been used to finance its trade.   The question is:
Why did Dr Ticktin deprive the corporation of the benefit of using its
own money and instead saddle it with the apparently unnecessary
burden of paying interest?
[6]      We have the answer from his own lips.   His evidence is that it
was agreed when he purchased the shares in the erstwhile company
that the purchase price would not be payable immediately because the
transaction was structured as a “loan”.   Asked about the way in which

the transaction was financed, he replied:
“The purchase price was about R1.8 million.   They gave me a loan
in my personal capacity for which I was going to service it via
Ticktin Timbers.”
Elsewhere he said:
“When I purchased the business and obtained a loan basically from
the family represented by the trusts, it was agreed that I would pay
them interest at 3 per cent below prime.
MR EMSLIE:  So, the interest on the loan account was pegged at
a similar figure, similar rate.   Would you agree with the statement
then that from your point of view, you wanted to be able to charge
interest on the amounts standing to your credit in your loan
account, so as to be able to pay interest to your brothers and
sisters? ... Certainly, yes.”
Equally instructive is the answer to a question which the Commissioner
posed in a letter to the appellant’s accountants after the appeal to the
Special Court had been noted.   The Commissioner wanted to know
what the purpose of the loan by the sellers of the shares was.   The
answer was as follows:
“1.   The purpose of the loans was to enable Dr Ticktin to acquire
his interest in the companies which in terms of the agreement were
to be converted into Close Corporations.   The agreement obliged
Dr Ticktin to structure his interest in the form of loan capital
(debt rather than equity) to the extent that this was done, thereby
ensuring that he would earn interest income.
2.   The agreement in terms of which Dr Ticktin was and is
liable to pay interest to the trusts also obliged him [to] advance
funds by way of loan capital.   The link between the interest
paid/incurred and the interest earned is thus clear.   The payment
of interest to the trusts was the sine qua non of the interest
earned by Dr Ticktin.”
These extracts from the record, particularly the portions  which I have

emphasized, reveal all that we need to know.   It is plain that the whole
scheme of diverting the corporation’s funds and making them available
again in the form of an interest bearing loan was devised and agreed
upon when Dr Ticktin bought the shares.   Its obvious aim was to
ensure that he would be able to pay the interest on the purchase price
(and possibly even the purchase price itself).
[7]      Appellant’s counsel argued that all this is irrelevant.   The motive
for Dr Ticktin’s actions, he submitted, does not concern us;  what has
to be determined is the corporation’s purpose in taking up the loan  and
on this we have Dr Ticktin’s evidence which is confirmed by the fact
that the money was used to finance the corporation’s trading. I do not
agree. When the corporation started trading it had already been agreed
that a loan account would be opened.   Qua member Dr Ticktin was
aware of his personal contractual obligation and there is no reason to
suspect, nor did he suggest in his evidence,  that he did not intend to
carry it out. As Nicholas AJA aptly remarked in Commissioner for Inland
Revenue v Pick `n Pay Wholesalers (Pty) Ltd 1987(3) SA 453 (A) at
470J in dealing with a comparable situation, “a man does not change
his mind when he changes his hat.”   I agree with the court a quo that
the loan was not needed for the appellant’s income producing activities

and that the intention was to increase Dr Ticktin’s income, not that of
the appellant.   The liability for the interest was accordingly not incurred
in the production of the latter’s income.   But, even if it was, the loan
plainly served a dual purpose, one of which had no bearing on the
appellant’s trade.   The deduction of the interest was thus prohibited by
s 23(g) and the Commissioner rightly refused to allow it.
[8]      There is another way of looking at the matter which leads to the
same result.  It is trite that interest paid on a loan which was raised in
order to enable a dividend to be paid is not expenditure incurred in the
production of income and is therefore not deductible.   A company or
corporation is not obliged to pay a dividend or make a distribution
respectively irrespective of the financial circumstances in which it finds
itself.   If, after doing so, it will have the resources to enable it to
continue its income earning activities without having to borrow
simultaneously an equivalent amount no problem arises.   When it will
not, but none the less pays a dividend or makes a distribution and
simultaneously raises a loan in exactly the same amount, it becomes
a question whether or not the purpose of the loan was to enable a
dividend to be paid or the distribution to be made or to provide the
entity with liquid funds required to enable it to pursue its income earning

activities.
[9] What happened in this case?   Simply put it amounts to this.
Appellant had enough money in its coffers to finance its income earning
operations without borrowing and incurring an obligation to pay interest.
It was under no obligation to use that money to make a distribution and
its controlling mind (that of Dr Ticktin) was well aware that, if it was
used for that purpose, it would be necessary to borrow simultaneously
an equivalent amount and pay interest on the loan.   It is quite clear that
the relevant transactions, namely, the making of the distribution on the
one hand, and the making of the loan, on the other, were not intended
to be separate and unconnected transactions.   They were plainly
interdependent and neither was intended to exist without the other.  It
is this linkage which, to my mind, is fatal for appellant’s case for it
shows that the true reason why appellant had to borrow back at interest
from Dr Ticktin money which it had had in its own coffers and was
under no obligation to part with, was because it wanted to make a
distribution to Dr Ticktin.   The fact that he was the sole owner of the
corporation makes it clearer still.   On that view of the matter, Dr
Ticktin’s personal obligations to his siblings are of little moment.   What
is of moment, as counsel for appellant rightly emphasised, is why

appellant incurred the interest bearing debt.   As I have said, the
answer seems plain: because it wished to make a distribution to Dr
Ticktin.  The interest was therefore not deductible.
[10] The criticism in 1997 SALJ 645 by Associate Professor Dendy of
the decision of the Court a quo is, in my view, misplaced and stems
from a failure to appreciate the significance of the linkage to which I
have referred and from an analysis of the transactions as if they were
not interdependent.  They obviously were and the conclusion of the
court a quo did not (as is suggested in the article) rest upon a wrong
assumption that the money in question was borrowed in order to
finance the making of the distribution.  It rested upon a correct finding
of fact on the evidence before the court that that was indeed the
purpose for which the appellant undertook to incur a liability to pay
interest which would not otherwise have existed.
[11]    It is of course so that the answer to the question whether or not
a loan is “needed” is not by itself conclusive in deciding whether interest
paid is deductible but it is certainly a highly relevant factor to be
weighed in conjunction with other relevant factors when examining
transactions in order to ascertain the real purpose driving them.
The concluding remarks in the article in question are

symptomatic of what I consider to be the faulty analysis of the problem
by its author:
“If Inland Revenue is not prepared to countenance the
treatment of interest on borrowed money as tax-deductible
in any situation in which a dividend has been declared,
then Parliament must be asked to amend the Income Tax
Act.  For, having allowed taxpayers to claim deductions
from gross income in respect of interest on money
borrowed for the purpose of producing income, the fisc
cannot be heard to cry foul if taxpayers so arrange their
financial affairs as to run their businesses on borrowed
money, and withdraw the profits earned by those
businesses in order to meet their personal debts.  (That
principle, indeed, was recognized as sound by Brand J
(Friedman JP and Farlam J concurring) in Van
Blommestein v Kommissaris  van  Binnelandse  Inkomste
1997 (1) JTLR 13 (C) at 21-23E, in which judgment was
delivered on the same day as the decision in Ticktin
Timbers.  The Van Blommestein judgment on the point was
incompatible with the test applied in Ticktin Timbers (see
1997 (1) JTLR at 4C-D, 1997 (3) SA at 629A-B).  Farlam
J, who concurred in the judgments in both matters,
apparently failed to see the inconsistency.)” (At 651.)
[12] The court a quo did not suggest that interest on borrowed
money is not tax-deductible “in any situation in which a dividend has
been declared”.  The second sentence conflates the identity of two
separate and distinct taxpayers (the business on the one hand and its
owner on the other) and begs the question.  If the business borrows
money at interest in order to distribute profits without a commensurate
loss of liquidity and it does so only because its owner needs money to

settle a personal debt, then the business has not in truth borrowed
money for the production of income.
[13] There is a clear conceptual distinction between, on the one
hand, a case in which a company in good faith and on the strength of
inaccurate financial statements furnished by employees declares and
pays a dividend, but shortly thereafter learns the true financial position
of the company and realises that the dividend should not have been
paid and that an equivalent sum will have to be borrowed to finance the
company’s trading activities and, on the other, a case such as the
present.  In the present case the purpose of the loan was to enable a
distribution to be made to Dr Ticktin.  Without the loan there would
have been no distribution;  without the distribution there would have
been no loan.   In the former case the interest paid will be deductible for
the loan was not procured in order to pay the dividend.  The fact that
the payment of the dividend was the historical cause of the company
needing to borrow is irrelevant.  The purpose of the borrowing was to
finance the company’s trading operations after it had parted with its
own resources while under the misapprehension that it could afford to
do so. The Van Blommestein case is quite distinguishable and I see no
inconsistency in the approach of the court which decided it and the

approach of the court a quo.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.

Respondent

SMALBERGER, GROSSKOPF, HARMS, OLIVIER
JJA and MADLANGA AJA
Heard:
19 AUGUST 1999
Delivered:
10 SEPTEMBER 1999
Key words: Civil procedure - lack of locus standi - ratification - leave to
appeal and balance of convenience
JUDGMENT
HARMS JA/

HARMS JA:
[1] The point in this appeal relates to a point in limine - it
concerns the locus standi (in the sense of a lack of authority) of Mr
Norman Watson who instituted these proceedings in the Eastern Cape
High Court, purportedly acting on behalf of the Town Council of
Kwanonqubela.  Pursuant to a stated case which dealt with this objection
only, Erasmus J came to the conclusion that Watson had the necessary
locus standi, and he dismissed the objection with costs.  The order is
appealable (cf Caroluskraal Farms (Edms) Bpk v Eerste Nasionale Bank
van Suider-Afrika Bpk 1994 (3) SA 407 (A)) and Erasmus J granted the
necessary leave.
[2] During the period of political upheaval and social unrest
which preceded the 1994 election, the appellant, Mr R T Smith, came
under pressure from the local civic organization.  He was at the time the
chief executive officer of the Town Council.  The civics also demanded

that the town councillors should resign en masse.  On 27 July 1993, the
Town Council adopted a resolution entitling Smith to take early retirement
due to political pressure.  Part of the resolution was to the effect that the
Council would pay him his full salary and other benefits for a further thirty
months, that his pension would be paid up and that certain car allowances
be paid to him. During the same meeting all the councillors resigned.
[3] At the time the Administrator of the Cape Province had
delegated power  to authorise any person to exercise, perform or fulfil the
rights, powers and functions of a local authority if, due to the number of
vacancies on the council, it was unable to act (s 29A of the Black Local
Authorities Act 102 of 1982; it was introduced by the Laws on Co-
operation and Development Second Amendment Act 90 of 1985).
Watson, an employee of the Provincial Administration, was duly
appointed in terms of this provision, initially from 6 August 1993 to 30

November 1993 and then from 1 December 1993 until 31 May 1994.
[4] The second term of his appointment was interrupted by the
repeal of the Black Local Authorities Act (see the Local Government
Transition Act 209 of 1993 which commenced on 2 February 1994).  In
spite of the repeal, any council or committee established under the
repealed act was to continue to exist (s 13(2) of the latter Act).  Erasmus
J held that Watson was neither a “council” nor a “committee” and that,
consequently, his authorisation to act in the stead of the Town Council
had lapsed on 2 February 1994.  In the end all of this is of academic or
historical interest only because the action taken by Watson in the name of
the Town Council, and which is the subject of the dispute, took place on
16 August 1994, a date well after the expiry of the second term of his
authorisation.
[5] On that date an application was launched in the name of the

Town Council, citing Smith as the respondent and praying for the setting
aside of the Town Council's resolution and for repayment of certain sums
of money paid to Smith according to the terms of the resolution. The
deponent to the founding affidavit was Watson who alleged that he was
duly authorised to act on behalf of the Town Council in bringing the
application by virtue of his appointment under s 29A of Act 102 of 1982
(dealt with in par [3] above).
[6] Apart from answering the allegations on the merits, Smith
raised the issue of Watson's lack of locus standi.  In his replying affidavit
Watson attempted to meet the point by alleging that his appointment had
in fact been extended from 1 June 1994, but with the change of
government the extension had not yet been published.  In the event no
appointment was published but by letter dated 29 November 1994 it was
recorded that authority had been granted for Watson's appointment as a

commissioner of the Town Council in terms of s 28(1) of the Municipal
Ordinance 20 of 1974 (Cape) for the period 1 June 1994 to 30 September
1994, covering the date of the institution of the application.
[7] Section 28(1) of the Ordinance empowers the Administrator
(now the Premier of the Province) to appoint a commissioner to act as the
council of a municipality if, at any time, the municipality has no
councillors.  The purported application of the provision gave rise , i a, to
the question whether the section by necessary implication authorises an
appointment with retroactive effect.  Erasmus J held in the affirmative and
had
""no difficulty in applying the fiction that at 16 August 1994 he
[Watson] had locus standi in judicio to bring the present
application, even though he acquired that status ex post facto.  It is
not a case of the Administrator ratifying Watson's act, or of him
validating Watson's void or voidable act (Baxter op cit 363-364);
but of Watson retrospectively acquiring the competency de novo to
have instituted the proceedings on 16 August 1994.""

The true respondent before us is therefore the Transitional Council, but the necessary
substitution has not yet taken place.  Nothing turns on the point.
On this basis the objection to Watson's locus standi was dismissed.
Although s 28 may by necessary implication authorise an appointment
with retroactive effect, I have some difficulty in appreciating the
difference between such an appointment and a ratification of actions taken
by the commissioner during that period.  For reasons that will become
apparent, I do not deem it necessary to decide the case upon this basis.
[8] In the course of the recent constitutional development the
Town Council was incorporated into the Alexandria Transitional Council
and it is not in dispute that the rights and duties of the Town Council
devolved upon the Transitional Council.1  The latter, at a meeting of 2
December 1994, discussed this case (according to the minutes) ""in full""
and resolved to proceed with it.  This, it is alleged by the Town Council
in the stated case, ""constituted sufficient authorisation of Watson's locus

standi to represent the Applicant"".  I proceed to consider the validity of
this submission which raises the question whether  Watson's unauthorised
institution of the proceedings was capable of ratification.
[9] It is in general essential for a valid ratification ""that there
must have been an intention on the part of the principal to confirm and
adopt the unauthorised acts of the agent done on his behalf, and that the
intention must be expressed either with full knowledge of all the material
circumstances, or with the object of confirming the agent's action in all
events, whatever the circumstances may be"" (Reid and Others v Warner
1907 TS 961 at 971 in fine - 972).  Counsel for Smith submitted that there
is no evidence that the councillors of the Transitional Council had
knowledge of the fact that Watson's action had been unauthorised and,
consequently, that the purported ratification was of no effect.  I do not
think, on the wording of the stated case, that this argument is open to

Smith.  In any event, the minutes of the meeting state that the matter was
discussed in full and, further, the decision to proceed with the case
evinces a clear intention to ratify whatever action was taken, irrespective
of the legal niceties involved.
[10] The next attack upon the purported ratification was along
these lines:  Watson's contentious act was an administrative one; it was
not authorised by law; an unauthorised act is invalid; an invalid act cannot
be ratified.  The argument, I fear, already breaks down at the first
proposition and it becomes unnecessary to consider the others.  The
launching of legal proceedings is not an administrative act but a
procedural one open to any member of the public.  Watson apparently
believed on insubstantial grounds that he had the necessary authority to
act on behalf of the Town Council.  He was wrong.  His expressed
intention was to act on behalf of the Town Council and not on his own

behalf.  It is a general rule of the law of agency that such an act of an
“unauthorised agent"" can be ratified with retrospective effect (cf
Uitenhage Municipality v Uys 1974 (3) SA (E) 806H-807H).
[11] It was further argued that, after an objection has been taken
to the authority of a person to act on behalf of another, reliance may not
be placed upon a ratification that did not exist when the objection was
taken.  The same issue arose in Moosa and Cassim NNO v Community
Development Board 1990 (3) SA 175 (A), and in the course of the
judgment Nicholas AJA (at 181B-C) noted that counsel had ""conceded,
correctly in my opinion"" that he could not urge upon this Court that the
rejection of the same submission in the court below was wrong.  I would
have thought that Nicholas AJA, as he was wont to do, expressed himself
clearly and said what he had in mind, namely that there was no merit in
the point.  Jansen J thought otherwise (South African Allied Workers'

Union and Others v De Klerk NO and Others 1990 (3) SA 425 (E) 431E-
433E) but Conradie J, with the customary deference, held that Jansen J's
interpretation was artificial (Merlin Gerin (Pty) Ltd v All Current and
Drive Centre (Pty) Ltd and Another 1994 (1) SA 659 (C) 661E).  Lest
there be any future doubt about the matter, this judgment holds that the
point is bad for the reasons that follow.
[12] Halsbury's Laws of England states since its first edition that:
""Ratification, to be effective, must be made either within a period
fixed by the nature of the particular case, or within a reasonable
time, after which it cannot be ratified to the prejudice of a third
person.""
(1st ed vol 1 par 384; 4th ed reissue vol 1(2) par 78).  This, the full court
in Finbro Furnishers (Pty) Ltd v Peimer 1935 CPD 378 at 380 found,
justified the general rule that when an act has to be done within a fixed
time, performance of that act by an unauthorised agent cannot be ratified

by the principal after the lapse of such fixed time to the prejudice of
another who has acquired some right or advantage from non-performance
within the fixed time.  As was pointed out rather pertinently in Garment
Workers' Union of the Cape and Another v Garment Workers' Union and
Another 1946 AD 370 at 378, the emphasis in that case was on acts which
have to be performed within a fixed time.  Both these cases dealt with
ratification of the unauthorised prosecution of appeals.  In Finbro the
ratification was held to be ineffectual because it took place after the
period fixed; in Garment Workers' Union the correctness of Finbro was
not considered because the ratification concerned took place within the
fixed period.  In the present case there was no fixed period within which
the proceedings in the court below had to be instituted, nor is it a
requirement that they have to be instituted within a reasonable time.
Neither the rule as formulated by Halsbury nor as restated in Finbro is

thus of application to the present case.
[13] Two principles, if not one, were mentioned in Jagersfontein
Garage & Transport Co v Secretary, State Advances Recoveries Office
1939 OPD 37: ratification cannot affect vested rights previously acquired
by third parties (at 41 in fine) and a person ratifying cannot by his
unilateral act bridge the interval so as to prejudice others, not parties to
the transaction (at 46 in fine - 47). In the context of the case the right
involved concerned ownership and the third party whose interest was at
stake was someone other than the agent, the principal and the other party
to the transaction.  Fisher J (at 41) pointed out that one authority,
Bowstead on Agency par 30 (probably the 8th ed) limited the proposition
to proprietary rights.  Bowstead has since wavered slightly and has
extended the rule to possessory rights vested in third parties (Bowstead &
Reynolds on Agency 16th ed art 20).  Windscheid  ( Lehrbuch des

Pandektenrechts par 74 presumably at vol 1 p 371), the other authority
quoted by Fisher J, also deals with substantive rights only and it is
apparent from his discussion that the third party he had in mind is not the
other party to the transaction.  Peckius De Regulis Juris X 16-17, also
relied upon, is too cryptic for any conclusion.  Van Jaarsveld Die Leerstuk
van Ratifikasie in die Suid-Afrikaanse Verteenwoordigingsreg (LLD
thesis, Pretoria, 1971) p 489-492, on the other hand, is quite clear that the
rights that may not be affected are substantive rights of a party other than
the third party to the transaction which, in the instant case, is the
litigation.
[14] Apart from the fact that no substantive right of a third party
is affected by the ratification, the next question is if any vested right of
Smith was affected or prejudiced.  Kannemeyer J in South African Milling
Co (Pty) Ltd v Reddy 1980 (3) SA 431 (SE) at 437F held that a

respondent acquired ""a right to move for the dismissal of the application
on the ground of lack of locus standi"".  Goldstone J had difficulty with
this because to him the so-called right is ""hardly what one would envisage
as constituting a 'vested right'.""  (See Baeck & Co SA (Pty) Ltd v Van
Zummeren and Another 1982 (2) SA 112 (W) 119H.)  Conradie J in
Merlin Gerin agreed with Goldstone J, reasoning that the right involved
is no more than the ""right"" to take a point and to require a court not to turn
a good point into a bad one.  I am in general in agreement with the
analysis and conclusion reached in Merlin Gerin.  Apart from making
perfectly good sense and being practical, it is legally sound.  A party to
litigation does not have the right to prevent the other party from rectifying
a procedural defect.  Were it otherwise, one party would for instance not
be entitled to amend a pleading, especially not after the filing of a valid
exception.  The ratification in the present instance did not affect any

substantive rights of Smith.
[15] In South African Milling (at 436F-437C) the matter was also
approached from a procedural point, namely that a party is not entitled to
make out a case in reply and that a ratification relied upon in reply
infringes this rule.  This part of the ratio is strictly speaking not apposite
to the present case because the issue here was decided upon a stated case
which did not raise this point.  It remains, however, in view of persistent
difficulties in this regard, necessary to emphasise that this Court in Moosa
and Cassim NNO has clearly adopted as correct the refutation in Baeck
& Co (at 114E-119B) of the approach, and to state that I fully subscribe
to that view .  The rule against new matter in reply is not absolute (cf Juta
& Co Ltd and Others v De Koker and Others 1994 (3) SA 499 (T) 511F)
and should be applied with a fair measure of common sense.  For instance,
in the present case, the point provided no material or substantial

advantage to Smith - at least, counsel could not point to any - and it
simply at great cost postponed the day of possible reckoning (cf Merlin
Gerin at 660I-J; National Co-op Dairies Ltd v Smith 1996 (2) SA 717 (N)
719E-F).
[16] Before concluding this judgment and dismissing the appeal,
I wish to draw attention to another procedural matter which is often
overlooked in the grant of leave to appeal and which causes delay and
unnecessary costs.  In Zweni v Minister of Law and Order 1993 (1) SA
523 (A) 531D it was said that, in granting leave to appeal, a court should
do more than consider whether the jurisdictional requirements for leave
are present:
""But, if the judgment or order sought to be appealed against does
not dispose of all the issues between the parties the balance of
convenience must, in addition, favour a piecemeal consideration of
the case.  In other words, the test is then 'whether the appeal - if
leave were given - would lead to a just and reasonably prompt

resolution of the real issue between the parties'.""
I am satisfied that if this consideration had been put to the judge below,
he would not have granted leave to appeal before the proceedings had
been terminated.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.

SCOTT AR/...

SCOTT AR:
[1] Die appellant, tesame met ’n mede-beskuldigde (‘beskuldigde 2’), het
in die Witwatersrandse Plaaslike Afdeling voor Coetzee R en assesore op een
aanklag van moord en een aanklag van roof met verswarende omstandighede
tereggestaan. Die appellant, wat tydens die verhoor 18 jaar oud was, is onskuldig
bevind aan moord maar skuldig bevind aan roof met verswarende omstandighede.
Hy is gevonnis tot 6 jaar gevangenisstraf, waarvan 2 jaar voorwaardelik vir 5 jaar
opgeskort is. Beskuldigde 2, wat tydens die verhoor 17 jaar oud was, is onskuldig
bevind op beide aanklagte.
[2] Na afhandeling van die saak en op versoek deur die staat is twee
regsvrae vir oorweging deur hierdie hof in terme van artikel 319 van die
Strafproseswet 51 van 1977 deur die verhoorregter voorbehou. Die eerste vraag
handel slegs met die posisie van die appellant; die tweede vraag slegs met die
posisie van beskuldigde 2.  Volgens die staat moes die hof altwee om verskillende

redes aan moord, of minstens ’n geoorloofde misdryf  ingevolge art 258 van die
Strafproseswet, skuldig bevind het. Verlof is terselfdertyd aan die appellant verleen
om teen sy skuldigbevinding aan roof met verswarende omstandighede te appelleer
en sy appèl dien tans voor hierdie hof.  Beskuldigde 2 is egter nie ’n party tot die
appèl nie; daar is ook geen verskyning namens hom in hierdie hof nie.
[3] Voordat die geskilpunte in die appèl oorweeg word, is dit nodig om
eers die feite van die saak kortliks uiteen te sit. Die oorledene, Leonard Tayitayi, is
op 5 Desember 1994 te Vrededorp, Gauteng, vermoor. Voortspruitend uit sy dood
is vier persone aanvanklik aangekla, die appellant en beskuldigde 2 in die huidige
saak (‘die twee beskuldigdes’) asook twee broers, Reinhard en Jaco Goosen.
Reinhard Goosen het skuldig gepleit aan moord asook diefstal van geld van sy ma.
Jaco Goosen het skuldig gepleit aan moord en roof met verswarende
omstandighede, d w s dieselfde aanklagte as in die huidige saak. Die twee
beskuldigdes het onskuldig gepleit en ’n skeiding van verhore is gelas. In die hof a

quo was die twee Goosen broers die enigste ooggetuies.
[4] Dit blyk dat in die laat middag op Maandag 5 Desember 1994 die twee
beskuldigdes, die Goosen broers en ander persone by die woonstel van die appellant
se ma te Vrededorp gesit en drink het. Die groep het die appellant se ma asook sy
stiefpa ingesluit. Dit blyk ook dat hulle almal ’n aansienlike hoeveelheid drank
ingeneem het. Om en by 10 nm het die Goosen broers tesame met die appellant se
broer, Riaan Venter, en ene Evert van der Merwe nog drank by ’n sjebeen gaan
koop. Op pad terug het hulle die oorledene opgemerk. Laasgenoemde het iets
gemompel en toe omgedraai en begin hardloop. Die Goosen broers het hom agterna
gesit en ingehaal. Die ander twee, Riaan Venter en Evert van der Westhuizen, het
aangestap. Volgens die Goosen broers het hulle die oorledene albei met die vuis in
die gesig geslaan. Nadat hy bewusteloos op die grond geval het is hy deur altwee
geskop. Hulle het getuig dat hulle in dié stadium die oorledene slegs teen sy lyf
geskop het. ’n Lykskouing wat op 8 Desember 1994 uitgevoer is,  het egter

aangetoon dat die beserings tot die oorledene se gesig en kop beperk was.  Geen
beserings is aan die lyf deur die pataloog tydens die lykskouing waargeneem nie.
Die oorsaak van dood was ‘n duik-fraktuur aan die skedel en ’n subdurale bloeding.
[5] Na hierdie aanval het die oorledene, volgens die Goosens, doodstil bly
lê. Hulle is toe terug na die woonstel waar hulle vir die groep vertel het, blykbaar
met ‘n groot mate van trots, wat hulle gedoen het. Omtrent 15 tot 20 minute daarna
is die Goosen broers saam met die twee beskuldigdes terug na die toneel. Die
oorledene het nog op dieselfde plek roerloos bly lê. Volgens hulle  het hulle almal
die oorledene toe geskop en geslaan. Aanvanklik het hulle te kenne gegee dat dit net
die twee beskuldigdes was wat die oorledene in die gesig geskop het. Later het hulle
erken dat hulle ook die oorledene teen sy kop en in die gesig geskop het.
[6] Die appellant het ook getuig. Hy het alle deelname aan die aanranding
ontken. Volgens hom het hy en beskuldigde 2 bloot uit nuuskierigheid die Goosens
terug na die toneel vergesel. Hy sê dit was slegs die Goosen broers wat die

oorledene toe aangerand het. Hy het egter erken dat hy op ‘n stadium die oorledene
se polshorlosie van sy arm afgehaal het. Hy sê hy het dit gedoen op versoek van
Jaco Goosen wat die horlosie toe dadelik uit sy hand gevat het. Sy weergawe
aangaande die horlosie is deur Jaco Goosen bevestig. Beskuldigde 2 het geswyg.
[7] Die hof a quo was van mening dat die Goosen broers nie oop kaarte
met die hof gespeel het nie  en dat daar nie op hulle getuienis gesteun kon word nie,
veral wanneer dit by die implisering van die appellant en beskuldigde 2 kom.  Die
Goosens is beskryf as ‘twee van die swakste getuies wat ons in ’n lang tyd voor ons
in hierdie hof gehad het’.   In die omstandighede was die hof a quo van mening dat
daar geen betroubare getuienis bestaan het om beskuldigde 2 te impliseer nie en dat
die enigste getuienis teen die appellant waarop die staat kon steun sy eie getuienis
aangaande die neem van die horlosie was.   Beskuldigde 2 is derhalwe onskuldig
bevind op altwee aanklagte en die appellant is onskuldig bevind aan moord maar
skuldig bevind aan roof met verswarende omstandighede.

[8] Dit is gerieflik om die posisie van beskuldigde 2 eers te oorweeg.
Uitspraak is deur die hof a quo op 13 Februarie 1996 gelewer en op daardie datum
is beskuldigde 2 onskuldig bevind en ontslaan. Die staat se ‘Kennisgewing van
Aansoek om Voorbehoud van Regsvrae’, gedateer 27 Februarie 1996, is op
beskuldigde se pro deo advokaat beteken. Die kennisgewing is blykbaar ook per
geregistreerde pos aan beskuldigde 2 by sy laasbekende adres gestuur. Die
kennisgewing het egter onafgehaal teruggekom. Omtrent 8 maande daarna en op 24
Oktober 1996 is die aansoek aangehoor. Beskuldigde 2 se pro deo advokaat het dit
onsuksesvol teengestaan. Dit blyk dat sy toe daarna niks meer met die saak te doen
gehad het nie.   Daar is geen aanduiding dat beskuldigde 2 enige kennis van die
aansoek gehad het nie of dat die advokaat tydens die aansoek op sy instruksies
opgetree het nie.  Daar is ook geen aanduiding in die oorkonde dat hy kennis dra
van die huidige verrigtinge of dat die verhoorregter ’n voorbehoue  regsvraag  na
hierdie hof verwys het nie.

[9] Nóg die Strafproseswet nóg die hofreëls maak uitdruklike voorsiening
in ’n geval soos die huidige vir die betekening op ’n beskuldigde of sy
regsverteenwoordiger van dokumente soos bv die staat se aansoek om die
voorbehoud van ’n regsvraag, ’n afskrif van die regsvraag soos deur die verhoorhof
vasgestel word, of ’n kennisgewing van die datum van die aanhoor van die
regsvraag deur hierdie hof. Dit is egter vanselfsprekend dat dokumente soos die
bogemelde wel beteken moet word sodat ’n beskuldigde die geleentheid verleen
word om sy saak voor hierdie hof te plaas. Die teendeel sou met die audi alteram
partem reël teenstrydig wees en is ondenkbaar. (Sien R van Wyk and Another 1960
(2) SA 106 (C).) Namens die staat is betoog dat weens die betekening van die
kennisgewing van aansoek op beskuldigde 2 se pro deo advokaat en haar verskyning
by die aanhoor van die aansoek, daar voldoende betekening op beskuldigde 2 was
en dat hierdie hof derhalwe geregtig is om met die beregting van die regsvraag
aangaande beskuldigde 2 voort te gaan. Ek kan nie saamstem nie. Wat die posisie

in die geval van ’n skuldigbevinding ookal mag wees - en ek spreek    geen
mening   hieroor uit nie - is dit  m i  vanselfsprekend dat in die afwesigheid van
enigiets tot die teendeel die mandaat van ’n advokaat om sy kliënt in ’n strafsaak te
verteenwoordig outomaties by die kliënt se ontslag beëindig word. Hierdie
benadering is ooreenstemmend met die gewone beginsel dat wanneer ’n opdrag
uitgevoer is, die mandaat outomaties tot ’n einde kom. (Vgl De Villiers and
Macintosh: The Law of Agency in South Africa 3 ed op 611; sien ook Pothier’s
Treatise on the Contract of Mandate, vertaal deur Rogers en De Wet, par 143 op
81.)   Enige betekening op beskuldigde 2 se pro deo advokaat na die beskuldigde
se ontslag kan dus nie as betekening op hom beskou word nie. Dit volg dat na my
mening die regsvraag aangaande beskuldigde 2 nie behoorlik voor hierdie hof is nie
en moet van die rol geskrap word.
[10] In elk geval en al word dit aanvaar dat betekening op die pro deo
advokaat as betekening op beskuldigde 2  beskou kan word, is ek van mening dat

die omstandighede sodanig is dat gewone beginsels van geregtigheid en billikheid
verhoed dat met die beregting van die regsvraag voortgegaan word. Soos reeds
gemeld, is daar geen verskyning namens beskuldigde 2 in hierdie hof nie. Daar is
ook geen aanduiding dat hy enige kennis van hierdie verrigtinge dra nie.
[11] Die voorbehoue regsvraag wat betrekking het op die appellant (soos
deur die verhoorregter vasgestel) lees soos volg:
“Of ’n skuldigbevinding aan moord, of minstens ’n bevoegde uitspraak op
daardie aanklag soos bedoel in artikel 258 van die Strafproseswet 51 van
1977 nie noodwendigerwys vir die [appellant] aangewese is in die lig van
feitelike bevindings en/of bewese feite soos bevind in hierdie verhoor nie”.
In S v Nkwenja en ’n Ander 1985 (2) 560 (A) op 567A - F het hierdie hof
beklemtoon dat wanneer ’n regsvraag soos in art 319 van die Strafproseswet
voorbehou word, daar sekerheid oor al die feite waarop die vraag betrekking het,
moet bestaan en dat die verhoorhof daardie feite in sy uitspraak as deel van die
voorbehoue vraag moet vermeld. Die vraag, soos deur die geleerde regter vasgestel,

is dus nie behoorlik voorbehou nie. Daar is egter ’n ander en miskien belangrike
aspek van die vraag wat aandag verg. Soos duidelik uit art 319 blyk,  is dit net ’n
regsvraag wat voorbehou kan word. Is die vraag wat hierbo aangehaal word
inderdaad ’n regsvraag of bloot ’n verskuilde feitevraag? Die verskil is nie altyd so
voor die hand  liggend nie.    In Magmoed v Janse van Rensburg and Others 1993
(1) SA 777 (A) op 808A - B tref Corbett HR ’n verskil tussen die vraag of bepaalde
bewese feite ‘n beskuldigde se handelinge binne die omvang van ’n besondere
misdaad bring en die vraag of  ‘the evidence establishes one or more of the factual
ingredients of a particular crime, when there is no doubt or dispute as to what those
ingredients are’.
[12] Die eerste vraag is ’n regsvraag. Wat  behels word is ‘an inquiry as to
the essence and scope of the crime charged’.   Die tweede vraag is ’n blote
feitevraag. In die onderhawige geval is dit duidelik dat die hof a quo nie die
appellant se ontkenning van enige deelname aan die aanranding op die oorledene

verwerp het nie.   Om sy skuld te bewys moes die staat daarom op die leerstuk van
gemeenskaplike opset steun, d w s op grond van ’n beweerde toetredingshandeling
aan die kant van die appellant. Die feitelike vereistes wat regtens nagekom moet
word om ’n gemeenskaplike opset in sulke omstandighede te bewys, is in S v
Mgedezi and Others 1989 (1) SA 687 (A) op 705 I - 706 C uiteengesit. Hierdie
vereistes is deur die hof a quo aanvaar. Wat wel in geskil was, is die vraag of die
getuienis voor die hof voldoende was om daardie vereistes te bewys. Dat dit die
geval was,  blyk uit die volgende passasie in die hof a quo se uitspraak.
“Dit is betoog dat beskuldigde 1 [appellant] deur middel van die leerstuk
van gemeenskaplike doel, ‘common purpose’ skuldig is aan moord deurdat
hy die horlosie verwyder het maar na ons mening het die Staat nie die
bewyslas gekwyt om vereistes [3,] 4 en 5 in S v Mgedezi and Others 1989
(1)
687 op 705 en 706 te bewys nie -
‘In the first place he must have been present at the scene where the
violence was being committed.’
Daaraan is voldoen.
‘Secondly he must have been aware of the assaults of the inmates of
room 12.’
Hy was bewus gewees van die aanranding op die oorledene.

‘Thirdly he must have intended to make common cause with those
who were actually perpetrating the assault.’
Daar is nie aanvaarbare getuienis dat hy gemeenskap gemaak het met die
plegers van die aanranding nie.
‘Fourthly he must have manifested his sharing of the common
purpose with the perpetrators of the assault by himself performing
some act of association with the conduct of the others.’
Daar is nie aanvaarbare getuienis dat dit gebeur het nie.
‘Fifthly, he must have had the requisite mens rea; so, in respect of the
killing of the deceased, he must have intended them to be killed.’
Daar is geen getuienis van dolus directus nie.
‘or he must have foreseen the possibility of their being killed and
performed his own act of association with recklessness as to whether
or not death was to ensue.’
Dit kan nie gesê word dat sy daad om die horlosie te verwyder van so ’n
‘aard was dat dit gereken kan word as dolus eventualis met betrekking tot
die moord nie’. ”
Die bevindings wat die hof a quo in hierdie passasie gemaak het is blote
feitebevindings. Dit is egter die juistheid van hierdie bevindings wat in werklikheid
die onderwerp is van die voorbehoue vraag. Dit volg dat dit niks ander as ’n
feitelike vraag is nie en val nie binne die bestek van art 319 van die Strafproseswet
nie.   (Sien bv die Magmoed saak, supra, op 802 E - 811 G waar hierdie hof tot die

slotsom gekom het dat ’n soortgelyke vraag nie ’n regsvraag was nie en dus nie ’n
vraag wat regtens in terme van art 319 voorbehou kon word nie.) In die
omstandighede bestaan daar geen grondslag waarop hierdie hof met die verhoorhof
se bevinding aangaande die aanklag van moord kan inmeng nie.
[13] Ek behandel nou die appellant se skuldigbevinding aan roof. In die hof
a quo is dit namens die appellant betoog dat daar nie bewys is dat toe die horlosie
vanaf die oorledene geneem is, hy nog geleef het nie. Die hof a quo het tot die
slotsom gekom dat dit wel bewys is en weens die appellant se erkenning dat hy die
horlosie geneem het, hy aan roof skuldig is.  Vir doeleindes van die appèl sal ek
aanvaar dat die oorledene nog geleef het. Die vraag wat ontstaan, is of die appellant
nogtans skuldig is aan roof.
[14] Dit is geykte reg dat die misdaad van roof slegs gepleeg word wanneer
daar ’n verbintenis bestaan tussen die elemente van diefstal en geweldpleging.    Met
ander woorde die gebruik van geweld of ’n dreigement van geweld moet met die

bedoeling wees om daardeur die slagoffer se wil tot weerstand uit te skakel of sy
weerstand te oorkom of te verhoed sodat die slagoffer se goed geneem kan word.
(Sien bv S v Moloto 1982 (1) SA 844 (A) op 850 B - C; S v Witbooi 1984 (1) SA
242 (K) op 245 H - 246 A; Ex parte Minister van Justisie : In re S v Seekoei 1984
(4) 690 (A) op 707 B - C.)
[15] Dit blyk uit die getuienis van die Goosen broers dat die motivering vir
die aanval op die oorledene blote boewery was. Nadat die oorledene bewusteloos
geslaan is het die Goosens hom nog geskop. Hulle is toe terug na die woonstel
sonder om sy horlosie of enigiets van hom af te neem. Daar was niks om hulle te
verhoed om sy goed te neem indien die motivering vir die geweldpleging diefstal
was nie. Met hulle terugkoms op die toneel saam met die beskuldigdes is die
oorledene weer op ’n brutale wyse aangerand. Weereens was hierdie aanval glad nie
nodig om die oorledene se goed te steel nie.   Hy het nog altyd bewusteloos en in
’n weerlose toestand bly lê. Alles dui daarop dat die verwydering van die horlosie

’n nagedagte was. Daar is in elk geval geen grondslag vir ’n afleiding dat die
aanranding gepleeg is met die opset om die oorledene se goed te steel nie. Na my
mening het die staat dus nie daarin geslaag om roof te bewys nie en moes die hof a
quo die appellant aan diefstal skuldig bevind het. Dit volg dat die appèl moet slaag.
[16] Die kwessie van vonnis moet opnuut oorweeg word. Tydens pleging
van die misdaad was die appellant 16 jaar en 11 maande oud. (Hy is nou 21 jaar
oud.)   Hy was ook ’n eerste oortreder. Dit is gemene saak dat hy die horlosie op
versoek van Jaco Goosen geneem het en dat laasgenoemde toe dadelik die horlosie
van hom afgeneem het. Aan die anderkant, kan die gruwelike omstandighede
waaronder die diefstal gepleeg is nie oor die hoof gesien word nie. In al die
omstandighede is ek van mening dat gevangenisstraf vir ’n tydperk van 6 maande
’n paslike vonnis sou wees. Die appellant is op 13 Februarie 1996 in die hof a quo
gevonnis. Ons is deur sy advokaat in kennis gestel dat hy nie borg hangende appèl
toegestaan is nie en dat hy moontlik nog besig is om die opgelegde gevangenisstraf

uit te dien.   Indien dit die geval is, volg dit dat hy onmiddellik vrygelaat  moet
word.
[17] Die volgende bevel word toegestaan:
(a)
Die appellant se appèl slaag; sy skuldigbevinding en vonnis
word tersyde gestel en met die volgende vervang.
“Beskuldigde 1 word skuldig bevind aan diefstal en word
gevonnis tot 6 maande gevangenisstraf.”
(b)
Die twee vrae wat deur die hof a quo vir oorweging deur
hierdie hof ingevolge die bepalings van art 319 van die
Strafproseswet voorbehou is, word van die rol geskrap.

MARAIS AR:
[1]          Ek beskou die diefstal deur die appellant gepleeg in ‘n baie ernstige lig.
Hy het die geleentheid deur die brutale en wrede aanranding van sy makkers op die
oorledene gebied, uitgebuit.  Die neem van die weerlose slagoffer se horlosie in
sodanige omstandighede was ‘n gemene en gevoellose daad.  Die oorledene was

klaarblyklik nie ‘n welgestelde persoon nie en die verlies van die horlosie sou vir
hom aansienlik gewees het.  Die beskuldigde was nagenoeg 17 jaar oud toe die
misdaad gepleeg is en alle aanduidings was dat hy die leefwyse van ‘n volwassene
alreeds begin ervaar het.  Hy was nie meer op skool nie.
[2]          Ek sou hom heelwaarskynlik of na ‘n verbeteringsskool verwys het of, as
die prognose vir suksesvolle rehabilitasie ongunstig was, hom tot tronkstraf vir ten
minste een jaar gevonnis het.  Aangesien hierdie ‘n minderheidsiening is, is dit nie
nodig om verder daarop in te gaan nie.  In alle ander opsigte stem ek met my
kollegas saam.

AND EXCISE First Appellant

LIMITED Second Appellant

and

Customs and Excise - Tariff headings 37.01 and 37.02 in Schedule 1 - Classification of
lithographic plate in rolls

JUDGMENT

STREICHER JA/

STREICHER JA:
[1] Both the respondent and the second appellant supply sensitised aluminium lithographic
printing plates to the printing industry. The plates which are supplied by the second appellant are
manufactured in South Africa and those that are supplied by the respondent are cut from an
imported product. In terms of s 47(9)(a)(i) of the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964 (""the Act"")
the first appellant determined that the imported product should be classified under tariff heading
37.01, Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Act attracting a 15% customs duty. On appeal to the Transvaal
Provincial Division, in terms of s 47(9)(e) of the Act, Mc Creath J set aside the first appellant's
determination and declared that the imported product fell to be classified under tariff heading
37.02 attracting no duty. Mc Creath J granted the appellants leave to appeal to this court.
[2] The imported product consists of rolls of photosensitised emulsion on aluminium substrates
0,15 mm, 0,30 mm, 0,35 mm or 0,40 mm thick, up to 2 500 m long and 1 260 mm wide. It is used
in the lithographic industry after it has been decurled, trimmed and cut in appropriately sized
individual sensitised plates. A lithographic printing plate can then be produced by placing a
negative or a positive film under vacuum in direct contact with the plate and exposing it to light.
Exposing it to light changes the characteristics of the coating on the plate only where it has
passed through the transparent portions of the film. This creates a positive image on the plate.
[3] In terms of s 47(1) of the Act duty is payable on all imported goods in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 1 to the Act. In Schedule 1 all goods generally handled in international
trade are systematically grouped in sections, chapters, and sub-chapters, which are given titles
indicating the broad class of goods each covers. Within each chapter and sub-chapter the
specific type of goods within the particular class is itemised by a description of the goods printed
in bold type. That description is defined in the Schedule as a ""heading"". Under the heading
appear sub-headings of the species of the goods in respect of which the duty payable is
expressed. The Schedule itself and each section and chapter are headed by ""notes"", that is, rules
for interpreting their provisions. (See in these respects Secretary for Customs & Excise v Thomas
Barlow & Sons Ltd 1970 (2) SA 660 (A) at 675D - F.) In addition, s 47(8)(a) provides that the
interpretation of Part 1 of Schedule 1 shall be subject to the Explanatory Notes to the Harmonized
System and to the Customs Co-operation Council Nomenclature issued by the Customs Co-
operation Council, Brussels, from time to time.
[4] Chapter 37 bears the title ""Photographic or Cinematographic Goods"". In terms of the general
rules for the interpretation of Schedule 1 the titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are
provided for ease of reference only and classification should be determined according to the
terms of the headings and relative section or chapter notes and, provided such headings or notes
do not otherwise require, according to certain other provisions.
[5] Tariff heading 37.01 reads:
""Photographic plates and film in the flat, sensitised, unexposed, of any material other than paper,
paperboard or textiles . . .""
Lithographic plates are specifically mentioned in some of the subheadings.

Tariff heading 37.02 reads:
""Photographic film in rolls, sensitised, unexposed, of any material other than paper, paperboard
or textiles . . .""
[6] In terms of Chapter Note 2 ""photographic"" ""relates to a process which permits the formation of
visible images directly or indirectly by the action of light or other forms of radiation on sensitive
surfaces"". It follows and is common cause between the parties that the finished lithographic
plates which the respondent and the second appellant supply to the printing industry would, if
imported in that form, be classified as photographic plates under tariff heading 37.01. However,
the court a quo held that the imported product fell to be classified under tariff heading 37.02
because, in the opinion of the judge, the word ""plates"" connoted flat material; the same intrinsic
products were covered by the two headings save that the form in which they were imported
differed; there were indications that tariff heading 37.01 was intended to apply to goods which
were end products; and the legislature did not intend to exclude plate material from the term
""photographic film in rolls"".
[7] The meanings of the words ""plates"" and ""film"" are not defined in Schedule 1. The words
therefore have to be given their ordinary meaning in the context in which they appear unless an
indication to the contrary is given.
[8] Dictionaries distinguish between plates and film in the context of photography. The Oxford
Dictionary contains the following definitions:
""(Film) a thin pellicle or coating of collodion, gelatin, etc. spread on photographic paper or plates,
or used by itself instead of a plate. Now esp. a thin, flexible, transparent material consisting
essentially of a plastic base or support (formerly of celluloid, now commonly of cellulose acetate)
coated on one side with one or more layers of emulsion and sold as a rolled strip and as separate
sheets; . . .""
""(Plate) a thin sheet of metal, porcelain, or (now usually) glass, coated with a film sensitive to
light, on which photographs are taken.""
In terms of the above definition of the word ""film"" the coating as such or the coating together with
its substrate may constitute a film.
Webster's Third New International Dictionary contains similar definitions of film and plate in the
context of photography. They read:
""(Film) a thin flexible transparent sheet of cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, or other plastic
material that is used for taking photographs and that is coated with a light-sensitive emulsion
which when exposed and developed contains negative or positive images in black, silver or in
color.""
""(Plate) a sheet of glass, metal, porcelain, or other material coated with a light-sensitive
photographic emulsion; . . .""
[9] According to these dictionary definitions rigidity would seem to be a distinguishing feature
between film and plates. In tariff heading 37.01 the legislature also distinguished between
photographic plates and photographic film. There would have been no need for the legislature to
do so if it considered them to be the same product intrinsically. Like the dictionary definitions the
distinguishing feature the legislature possibly had in mind was the rigidity of the substrate but the
essential difference is uncertain. In this case it need not be determined. It is common cause

between the parties, correctly so, that the imported product, once it has been decurled, trimmed
and cut in appropriately sized individual sensitised plates, is a lithographic plate and, in the
terminology of tariff heading 37.01, a photographic plate.
[10] Having distinguished between photographic plates and photographic film in tariff heading
37.01 one would have expected a reference to photographic plates in tariff heading 37.02 if the
legislature intended photographic plate or plates in coil form to fall under tariff heading 37.02. I
disagree with the contention that, because the word ""plates"" generally connotes flat material, one
would not speak of plate or plates in rolls. A flat sheet of the imported product which can be cut
into a number of lithographic plates is itself a lithographic plate and by coiling such a lithographic
plate for delivery or storage purposes the character of that lithographic plate is not changed. It
remains a lithographic plate and can be described as a lithographic plate in a roll, or, more
pertinently, as a photographic plate in a roll. In the respondent's own founding affidavit its
chairman speaks of ""a technique that had been developed for manufacturing sensitized
lithographic plate in lengthy coils or rolls"". Furthermore, in one of the respondent's brochures it is
stated that ""Polychrome GmbH has perfected the ability to ship high quality coated rolls of
lithographic plate thus enabling Kemtek to finish these rolls to the size requirements of the local
market and Kemtek's export market"". If lithographic plates are coiled two at a time it would in my
view be correct to describe them as photographic plates in rolls. In terms of s 6 of the
Interpretation Act 33 of 1957 words in the plural include the singular. It follows that if the
legislature intended photographic plate or plates in rolls to fall under tariff heading 37.02 there
was no reason for it not to mention photographic plate or plates in rolls under that heading. The
fact that the legislature did not is in my view a strong indication that it did not intend the phrase ""in
the flat""in tariff heading 37.01 to qualify film as well as plates and did not intend rolls of
lithographic plate or plates to fall under tariff heading 37.02.
[11] The respondent submits that the reference by the legislature in tariff heading 37.01 to X-ray
plates and in the explanatory notes to tariff heading 37.02 to X-ray film in rolls support its
argument that photographic plates and photographic film, within the meaning of those words in
tariff headings 37.01 and 37.02, are intrinsically the same product and that the difference
between the articles falling under tariff heading 37.01 and tariff heading 37.02 is the form in which
they are imported. I do not agree. The legislature not only distinguished between photographic
plates and film in rolls but distinguished between photographic plates, film in the flat, and film in
rolls. This is borne out by the fact that ""fluorographic plates and film in the flat"" for X-rays are
specifically mentioned under tariff heading 37.01 while it is stated in the explanatory notes to tariff
heading 37.02 that X-ray film in rolls is generally sensitised on both sides. There is no indication
to be found in the schedule that when the legislature spoke of X-ray film in rolls it had in mind X-
ray plate material in rolls or an article destined to be used as X-ray film in the flat. The reference
to X-ray plates, X-ray film in the flat and X-ray film in rolls therefore do not indicate that the
essential difference between tariff headings 37.01 and 37.02 lay in the form in which the article in
question was being imported.
[12] In the explanatory note to tariff heading 37.02 it is stated that the film referred to in that
heading may be used, like the photographic plates of tariff heading 37.01, for amateur,
professional photomechanical, scientific, radiographic, etc., purposes. Contrary to the submission
that one can deduce from this statement that the same intrinsic product was intended to be
covered save in respect of the form in which the product was imported, I am of the view that the
statement indicates that two different products were intended. If the same intrinsic product was
intended it would have been unnecessary to say that the film of tariff heading 37.02 may be used
for the same purposes as the photographic plates of tariff heading 37.01. This is self-evidently the
reason why no reference to film in the flat is made in this portion of the note.
[13] I also do not agree with the finding of the judge a quo and the submission by the respondent
that there are clear indications in chapter 37 that tariff heading 37.01 was intended to apply to
goods which were ready for use, end-products. Fluorographic plates, film in the flat, instant print

film of paperboard, offset duplicating masters and lithographic plates are categorised under tariff
heading 37.01 and in some cases the sub-categories are based on the thickness of the plate or
film. In the explanatory note to tariff heading 37.02 it is said that photographic film not cut to
usable sizes remains classifiable in this heading. The respondent submits that the implication is
that tariff heading 37.01 was intended primarily to cover plates and film cut to usable sizes.
However, there can be no doubt that a flat sheet of lithographic plate which still has to be cut in
usable sizes should be classified under tariff heading 37.01. The inference contended for can
therefore not be drawn.
[14] Another indication that photographic plate material is classifiable under tariff heading 37.02
is, according to the respondent, to be found in the explanatory note to tariff heading 37.02 to the
effect that the heading does not cover ""unexposed photographic plates and film in the flat"". The
reference to photographic plates would according to the respondent not have been necessary if
plates or plate material was intended to be excluded from the term ""photographic film in rolls"".
There is no merit in this contention. On this basis it can be argued that the exclusion of ""film in the
flat"" is an indication that it would have qualified as ""film in rolls"" had it not been for the exclusion.
The note simply states a fact which is self-evident.
[15] The respondent concedes, as it is bound to do, that for it to succeed a wider meaning has to
be given to the word ""film"" in tariff heading 37.02 than in tariff heading 37.01. There is however a
well known presumption that where the legislature uses the same word in the same enactment it
would intend the word to be understood, where no clear indication to the contrary is given, in the
same sense throughout the enactment. This would apply with even greater force where the word
is used in two tariff headings the one following upon the other (see Minister of the Interior v
Machadodorp Investments (Pty) Ltd 1957 (2) SA 395 (A) at 404 D-E).
[16] In my view there are no indications in Schedule 1 that the legislature intended to include rolls
of lithographic plate or plates to fall under ""film in rolls"". The omission of any reference to
photographic plates in tariff heading 37.02 after having mentioned them together with film in the
flat in tariff heading 37.01 therefore justifies an inference to the contrary.
[17] The articles in question are lithographic plates and the first respondent correctly determined
that they should be classified as photographic plates under tariff heading 37.01. The court a quo
erred in upholding the appeal against such determination.
[18] In the result the appeal is upheld with costs including the costs of two counsel. The order by
the court a quo is set aside and the following order is substituted therefor:
""The appellant's appeal is dismissed with costs including the costs of two counsel.""

Officer’s conduct after conviction vitiating whole trial.
J U D G M E N T
/HOWIE JA:. . .

HOWIE JA:
[1] The question in this appeal is whether irregularities which
occurred in the course of the appellant’s criminal trial after he had been
found guilty vitiated not only the sentence but all the proceedings.
[2] He was convicted in a magistrate’s court of assault with
intent to do grievous bodily harm and sentenced to a fine and suspended
imprisonment.   By reason of alleged irregularities in the post-conviction
proceedings and alleged misdirections in the judgment on conviction he
took the matter to the High Court at Johannesburg on both review and
appeal.   The review application was  dealt with and the appeal
postponed.   The relief sought on review was the setting aside of the
conviction and the sentence.  The Court a quo (Van der Merwe and
Schwartzman JJ) found the alleged irregularities to have occurred.
However, understanding the appellant’s counsel to have conceded that
they did not warrant the setting aside of the conviction, the Court focused

its attention solely on their effect on sentence.   It concluded that the
sentence was indeed vitiated and ordered i a  that the application directed
at the conviction be dismissed, that the sentence be set aside and that the
matter be remitted for sentence afresh by a different magistrate.  In
seeking leave to appeal against this result the appellant contended that the
Court below had erred in not finding the entire trial to have been vitiated.
The leave application came before Heher and Schwartzman JJ and was
granted.
[3] The material upon which the question in issue must be
decided consists of the trial record and the affidavits comprising the
review application.   The relevant facts and circumstances which emerge
are these.   On the evening of 30 November 1994, and in the parking lot
of a steakhouse in a Johannesburg suburb, two incidents occurred
involving the appellant and the complainant.  The complainant was in the
company of the lady who by the time of the trial had become his wife, and

her sister.   Having had their evening meal, they were on the point of
leaving.   The sister had come in her own car and before driving away she
handed the complainant a hacksaw which she had borrowed from him
earlier.   As the three of  them were standing conversing before departure,
the appellant came out of the steakhouse where he was having supper and
passed them on his way to fetch cigarettes from his car.   Whether he
rushed rudely between them, as the complainant testified, or whether, as
he himself said, he bumped into the complainant accidentally, one or
other event triggered the first incident.   Each man swore profusely at the
other and a short while later the complainant hit the appellant with the
hacksaw.   According to the complainant he was standing with the
hacksaw in his hand trying to get into his car to leave.  The  appellant
came towards him and pushed his wife out of the way.   In frightened
reaction he struck the appellant once on the shoulder with the back of the
hacksaw.   He denied the allegation put to him by the attorney then

appearing for the appellant that he had struck the appellant multiple
blows on the back and on his neck or that he had done anything to
provoke the attack.
[4] The other material witness for the prosecution was the
complainant’s wife.   She testified that after the appellant pushed her aside
he hit out at the complainant who retaliated by striking the appellant
several times with the hacksaw.   Both she and the complainant said that
after being struck the appellant turned and  ran away into the steakhouse.
She denied the allegation put on his behalf that while running away he
had been chased by the complainant through the car park.   It is therefore
implicit in the prosecution evidence that the appellant was struck by the
complainant from the front.
[5] The appellant’s version of the first incident was that after the
exchange of abuse he pushed the complainant (not the wife) who reacted
by striking him a blow with the hacksaw.   The appellant turned and ran.

The complainant then chased him around the parking area continuously
hitting him from behind with the hacksaw.   As a consequence he
sustained numerous cuts to the back of his head and on his back and in
support of this allegation he claimed  to have a doctor’s report confirming
the existence of such wounds.   (As will appear presently there was
indeed such a report available.)    Eventually he eluded the complainant
and ran into the steakhouse.  There he met his uncle who was one of the
family party with whom he was having supper and he reported to the
uncle what had occurred.
[6] The second incident followed very shortly afterwards and it
was this occurrence which was the subject of the charge.   The detail is
unimportant for present purposes.   It suffices to say that the appellant and
the uncle went out and encountered the complainant in the car park.   The
latter was struck a number of fist blows and fell to the ground.   The
prosecution case was  that the appellant and his uncle perpetrated this

attack on the complainant and that while he lay on the ground they
persistently kicked him.   The appellant’s case was that he took no part
in the assault.   He said his uncle struck the complainant a number of fist
blows but did nothing to complainant on the ground.  It was not in dispute
that as a result of the second incident the complainant had, by the time of
the trial, lost the sight of his right eye, with only the uncertain prospect of
possible surgical restoration.
[7] The appellant’s attorney did not call medical evidence to
substantiate the existence of his alleged wounds.   Instead he called the
appellant’s mother.  She testified that on the following day she saw eight
or nine  cuts on his back and a bruise on one of his shoulders.
[8] From this brief summary it will be apparent that the issue of
guilt was essentially one of credibility.   In resolving it the magistrate
believed the complainant and his wife and rejected the appellant’s
evidence.   Although in the normal course a review does not usually entail

consideration of evidential detail or factual findings, it is nonetheless
necessary in this particular instance, in order  to provide the required
perspective for what follows, to refer, as I have done, to aspects of the
evidence and also to point to some of the trial court’s  credibility
conclusions.   In the interests of maintaining a logical sequence it is
appropriate to turn to those  conclusions now.
[9] The magistrate referred in his summary of the facts to the
appellant’s and his mother’s evidence as to injuries on his head and back
but failed  to state whether he accepted it or, if he did, what significance
he attached to it.   However, his acceptance of the evidence of the
complainant and his wife without reservation would seem to indicate that
he disbelieved or at least disregarded the injury evidence.   This despite
the fact that the mother’s testimony was not rejected and despite the
support which it afforded for the appellant’s allegation that he was struck
more than a few times and, what is more, struck from behind while being

pursued by the complainant.   Plainly, the injury evidence is inconsistent
with the prosecution evidence and the latter cannot explain it.
[10] As regards the appellant’s evidence the magistrate said that
he —
“(gave) the impression . . . of a person who is
very agile.  He is fit.  He does not sustain any
kind of physical setbacks.   He was quick
spoken and very witty and he answered the
questions asked by the prosecutor snappy and
fast forward.”
[11] Making due allowance for the fact that English was not the
magistrate’s mother tongue and for the inevitable pressures of delivering
ex tempore judgments in the course of a busy day, it is nevertheless far
from  clear what this passage was intended to convey apart, perhaps, from
the apparent finding that the appellant was conspicuously articulate.  The
appellant sought to establish that he did indeed suffer “physical setbacks”
during the first incident.  Conceivably, however, the reference to agility

was a preface to a later passage reading as follows (the reference being
to the first incident):
“(The complainant) being already
agitated by the verbal abuse fight, surely at that
stage would have encountered a fight to the
extent that you would have had injuries to your
face part or your body part but the injuries
sustained according to you, and which were
left were injuries to the back of your body.
Being to the back of your body the court
has to take note that you were agile enough at
that moment that if (the complainant) lunged at
you he would not have been able to strike a
blow to the front of your body.”   (My
emphasis.)
The magistrate then proceeded to find, on the strength of other
considerations,  which I need not discuss, that the complainant did not
chase the appellant through the car park.   It must follow, therefore, that
he rejected the allegation that the injuries (if they were sustained at all)
were inflicted in the circumstances alleged by the appellant.   That being

so, the passage just quoted could mean one of two things: either that any
injuries would probably have been inflicted from the front and therefore
the injury evidence was untrue or that the appellant was able to evade
each successive blow from the front by deftly turning his back and that
was how he came to be injured.    The appellant’s inferred readiness to
remain on the spot to go on risking repeated blows with the hacksaw
certainly conjures up an extraordinary picture but apart from that the
passage in question either fails to explain the injuries or explains them on
a basis unacceptably at odds with the prosecution evidence.
[12] The hacksaw assault - for this is plainly what it was on the
appellant’s case - was obviously a highly relevant prelude to the second
incident and it is remarkable that the defence attorney did not put the
contents of the medical report to the complainant and his wife or call the
doctor concerned so as to emphasise the number of injuries and, by doing
so, to establish the number of blows struck by the complainant.   I

consider, therefore, that consequent upon conviction the appellant was
entitled to feel aggrieved at the magistrate’s approach to the matter of the
first incident.   I think he would also have harboured the understandable
incentive, by reason of  what he was found to have done to the
complainant, to show as clearly as possible what the complainant had
done to him.
[13]     In these circumstances it is not altogether surprising that
subsequent to the conviction, when the case was postponed for some four
months, the appellant terminated the services of his erstwhile attorney and
engaged another attorney, and counsel, for the resumption.
[14]  When the case continued, counsel called a general
practitioner, Dr Lamberti, who had examined the appellant on the day
following the incidents in issue.   Counsel had not yet elicited the
examination findings when the magistrate said that he was not busy with
“the trial proceedings” and that he did not think that the evidence had any

effect on mitigation. He nevertheless allowed the evidence to continue for
a while but soon afterwards, still in evidence-in-chief, he stopped the
proceedings.  In his affidavit in the review application the appellant
alleges that up to that stage the magistrate displayed displeasure at the
calling of the doctor and disinterest in what he had to say.   In describing
the stopping of the proceedings, the appellant alleged:
“the Magistrate exclaimed ‘Just hold there, please stop’,
forcefully switched off the recording device, jumped up
exclaiming loudly ‘Right, that is it, that is it’ and rushed out
of Court.”
No affidavit by the magistrate was filed.   The prosecutor who appeared
in the case after the resumption (she did not appear in the matter up to that
stage) swore an affidavit which offers no denial of those allegations.
All she can say is that she cannot remember the magistrate’s alleged
displeasure and disinterest.
[15] Some minutes later the magistrate returned and the hearing

of the doctor’s evidence proceeded to completion.   It is not denied that
the magistrate bore the continuation with noticeable irritation.  The thrust
of the medical evidence was that the appellant exhibited eight fresh
separate abrasions; two were on the back of the neck, five on his back and
one on the anterior aspect of the top of the left shoulder; and each
abrasion indicated a separate blow.
[16] Counsel for the appellant then applied for an exercise of the
magistrate’s discretion to recall the complainant, obviously wishing,  one
necessarily infers, to cross-examine him inter alia on those aspects of the
medical evidence which are of patent significance relative to the first
incident.  The record shows - and this is not denied by the prosecutor -
that the magistrate denied counsel the opportunity to complete argument
on the matter and refused the application without reasons.  The appellant
goes on to allege that  while counsel attempted to argue the application
the magistrate switched off the recorder and maintained an intimidating

stare at counsel for some minutes, refusing in silence repeated requests for
the machine to be switched on and the matter to resume.  The
prosecutor’s only comment  in her affidavit is to describe the magistrate’s
stare as frustrated rather than intimidating.
[17]    Counsel then informed the magistrate that there were
material contradictions between the complainant’s evidence and his police
statement.  The magistrate indicated that this  was irrelevant and required
counsel to continue with the matter of mitigation.   Counsel responded by
applying for an adjournment so that he could tell the Senior Prosecutor of
the prosecution’s failure to draw the contradictions to the magistrate’s
attention during the presentation of its evidence.  When this application
was summarily refused counsel sought and was granted an adjournment
to consult with the appellant.  During the adjournment, and after such
consultation, counsel obtained the Senior Prosecutor’s agreement to the
handing in by consent of the complainant’s police statement.

[18]     When the hearing resumed the prosecutor informed the
court that she was prepared to hand in the statement which, she added,
had been available to the defence from the beginning of the trial.   The
magistrate commented that it should have been handed in before judgment
and that the issues pertinent to the judgment had already been dealt with.
The appellant says in his affidavit that the prosecutor’s tender of the
statement annoyed the magistrate to the extent that he again switched off
the recording  machine   and    told the prosecutor that he wanted to see
her.   The two of them then left the courtroom.  Counsel was not invited
to be present.  During this adjournment the appellant saw the magistrate
and the prosecutor in a nearby corridor in discussion.   The magistrate’s
attitude towards the prosecutor appeared to be heated and authoritative.
The appellant inferred that they were discussing his case and the
prosecutor confirms that this was indeed so.  When the proceedings again
resumed, admission of the statement was refused without the opportunity

for argument by counsel and without reasons for the refusal.
[19] The defence responded by applying for the magistrate’s
recusal on the ground of his private discussion with the prosecutor which,
said counsel, had been witnessed by his client, in whom it had engendered
misgivings regarding the fairness of the proceedings.   The magistrate
denied counsel the opportunity to argue the application and refused it
without reasons.
[20] In what ensued counsel was confined to arguing mitigating
factors on the evidence as it stood, which argument the magistrate heard -
according to the appellant - in “bored and disinterested” fashion.
[21] When, immediately after argument, the magistrate gave
judgment on the matter of sentence he described the first incident as
merely “an argument and a squabble”, omitting altogether any reference
to blows struck by the complainant or their reasonably possible
provocative effect relative to the second incident.

[22] Applying the law to these facts, the starting point is that the
trial took place while the Interim Constitution (the Constitution of the
Republic of South Africa, 1993) was in force and in terms of s 25(3) the
appellant was entitled to a fair trial.   Vital ingredients of such a trial are
that it be held in public (cf s 25 (3) (a) ) and that, on hallowed authority,
justice be done and be seen to be done.   In what is seen to be done,
appearances play a varied role in the fulfilment of the need for fairness.
The appearance of justice is not enough.  Justice must not simply seem to
be done.   On the other hand the appearance of bias may be enough to
vitiate the trial in whole or in part.
[23] That justice publicly be seen to be done necessitates, as an
elementary requirement to avoid the appearance that justice is being
administered in secret, that the presiding judicial officer should have no
communication whatever with either party except in the presence of the
other: R v Maharaj 1960 (4) SA 256 (N) at 258 B - C.   That is so

fundamentally important that the discussion between the magistrate and
the prosecutor in the instant case warranted on its own, without anything
more, the setting aside of the sentence.   Had such a discussion occurred
before conviction in this matter there can be no question but that the
conviction would have been fatally irregular: S v Seedat 1971 (1) SA 789
(N) at 792 F.   In Seedat’s case, it may be noted, the vitiating irregularities
occurred after conviction but only the sentence was set aside.   However,
guilt was never in issue because the appellant there pleaded guilty at the
start of the trial.   There was therefore no basis on which it could have
been said that the irregularities tainted the conviction.   The case is
therefore of no assistance now.
[24] Here, of course, the irregular discussion does not stand
alone.   It prompted an immediate recusal application and that application
brought to the fore the question whether the magistrate’s conduct bore the
appearance of bias.  The Court a quo found affirmatively but, as already

remarked, it understood the disqualifying effect of such bias to attach only
to the sentence.
[25] Bias in the sense of judicial bias  has been said to mean —
“a departure from the standard of even-handed
justice which the law requires from those who
occupy judicial office.”
See: Franklin v Minister of Town and Country Planning [1948] AC 87
(HL) at 103, [1947] 2 All ER 289 (HL) at 296 B - C.    What the law
requires is not only that a judicial officer must conduct the trial open-
mindedly, impartially and fairly but that such conduct must be —
“manifest to all those who are concerned in the
trial and its outcome, especially the accused”:
see S v Rall, 1982 (1) SA 828 (A) at 831 H - 832 A.
[26] It is settled law that not only actual bias but also the
appearance of bias disqualifies a judicial officer from presiding (or

continuing to preside) over judicial proceedings.   The disqualification is
so complete that continuing to preside after recusal should have occurred
renders the further “proceedings” a nullity: Council of Review, South
African Defence Force v Mönnig 1992 (3) SA 482 (A) at 495 B - C;
Moch v Nedtravel (Pty) Ltd t/a American Express Travel Service  1996
(3) SA 1 (A) at 9 G.
[27] For too long, however, the legal test for the appearance of
judicial bias was uncertain.   This was because it was variously and, with
respect, at times confusingly stated both here and in England.   The way
in which the test has now come to be formulated in South Africa can be
traced in the following recent pronouncements of this Court.
[28] In S v Malindi 1990 (1) SA 962 (A) at 969 G - I it was said:
“The common law basis of the duty of a
judicial officer in certain circumstances to
recuse himself was fully examined in the cases
of  S v Radebe 1973 (1) SA 796 (A) and South
African Motor Acceptance Corporation

(Edms) Bpk v Oberholzer 1974 (4) SA 808 (T).
Broadly speaking, the duty of recusal arises
where it appears that the judicial officer has an
interest in the case or where there is some other
reasonable ground for believing that there is a
likelihood of bias on the part of the judicial
officer:  that is, that he will not adjudicate
impartially.   The matter must be regarded from
the point of view of the reasonable litigant and
the test is an objective one.   The fact that in
reality the judicial officer was impartial or is
likely to be impartial is not the test.   It is the
reasonable perception of the parties as to his
impartiality that is important. ""
[29] Then, Mönnig's case foreshadowed a switch from
""likelihood"" to ""reasonable suspicion"" but left the choice of formulation
open.  At 490 C - G it was said:
""It may be that this formulation [likelihood of
bias] requires some elucidation, particularly in
regard to the meaning of the word 'likelihood':
whether it postulates a probability or a mere
possibility.   Conceivably it is more accurate to

speak of 'a reasonable suspicion of bias'.
Suspicion, in this context, includes the idea of
the mere possibility of the existence, present or
future, of some state of affairs .   (The Oxford
English Dictionary sv 'suspicion and 'suspect');
but before the suspicion can constitute a ground
for recusal it must be founded on reasonable
grounds.
It is not necessary, however, to finally
decide these matters for, whatever the correct
formulation may be, I am satisfied that the
Court a quo was correct in holding that the
court martial did not pose the correct test when
deciding the recusal issue (see reported
judgment at 875 J - 876 B); and that the
circumstances were such that a reasonable
person in the position of second respondent
could have thought that
'. . . the risk of an unfair
determination on an issue such as
this was unacceptably high'.
(See reported judgment at 881 H - I)”
(The reported judgment mentioned  at the end of that extract is  the

judgment in Mönnig's case of the Full Court of the Cape Provincial
Division reported in 1989 (4) SA 866 (C).)
[30] Later, in BTR Industries South Africa (Pty) Ltd v Metal and
Allied Workers’  Union 1992 (3) SA 673 (A) it was finally laid down (at
693 I - J)
“[T]hat in our law the existence of a reasonable
suspicion of bias satisfies the test; and that an
apprehension of a real likelihood that the
decision maker will be biased is not a
prerequisite for disqualifying bias.”
The Court went on (at 694 A) to approve the statement by the Court a quo
in Mönnig’s case that
“provided the suspicion is one which might
reasonably be entertained, the possibility of
bias where none is to be expected serves to
disqualify the decision maker”
and at 694 J referred to the required suspicion as one which “might

reasonably be entertained by a lay litigant”.
[31] Adoption of the reasonable suspicion test in preference to the
real likelihood test was confirmed in Moch’s case at 8 H - I.
[32] Thus far, therefore, the requirements of the test thus finalised
are as follows as applied to judicial proceedings:
(1)
There must be a suspicion that the judicial officer might, not would,
be biased.
(2)
The suspicion must be that of a reasonable person in the position of
the accused or litigant.
(3) The suspicion must be based on reasonable grounds.
[33] It remains, in my respectful view, to add a gloss in order to
clarify one last aspect which could occasion confusion.   Is the suspicion
referred to one which the reasonable person merely might have or, on the
other hand, would have?   It will be noted that this Court’s formulations
and statements to which I have referred employ the words “could” (in

Mönnig’s case at 490 F) and “might” (in the BTR case at 694 A and J).
However, the point was one which did not arise for decision and a reading
of those judgments, and that of the Full Bench of the Cape Provincial
Division in Mönnig’s case, reveals clearly enough, I think, that the latter
was the source of this Court’s word usage.  That usage (rather than
choice), resulted really from the citation, with approval, of the passages
in the earlier Mönnig case at 879 B and 881 I in which the phrases “might
reasonably be entertained” and “could reasonably have thought”
respectively appear.   On analysis, the thrust of those passages is that the
test is satisfied if the suspicion of possible bias is reasonably founded.   In
view of what this Court was deciding it was that feature which prompted
the citations in question, not any preference for “might” or “could” above
“would”.   Significantly, there are other passages in the earlier Mönnig
judgment in which the word “would” is employed when expressing the
self same conclusion: see 881 D - E and H.   In the circumstances the

choice is therefore open.
[34] There can be little doubt that it would detract from the
efficacy and decisiveness of the bias test if one were to say that the
suspicion concerned is one which the notional reasonable person  might
have.  That would be inconclusive.   One needs to assess what such person
would think, not what such person might possibly think.   “Might” in that
regard, is no more significant than “might not”.   And, as pointed out in
Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, 7th ed, 482 “. . . if there was no
real possibility of bias, no reasonable person would suspect it.”   Equating,
as I think one must, “real” with “reasonable”, that comment emphasises
that if the suspicion of bias is one based on reasonable grounds the
reasonable person would have it.  If it were not so founded the reasonable
person would not have it.   “Might” has no place in this portion of the
formulation in my opinion.  One must therefore add to the requirements of
the test:

(4) The suspicion is one which the reasonable person referred to
would, not might, have.
[35] It is appropriate to observe that in England the House of
Lords, in R v Gough [1993] AC 646 (H. L. (E.),  [1993] 2 All ER 724 )
has now laid down that the test for apparent bias in relation to all courts
and tribunals (save where the tribunal has a pecuniary or proprietary
interest in the subject matter of the proceedings)  is the “real danger” of
bias.   It is satisfied if there appears to the Court (that is to say,  the
appellate court later considering or reviewing proceedings below) that
there is a “real likelihood, in the sense of a real possibility of bias”   which
possibility is equivalent to a “real danger” (at 668 B - E and 670 E - F
(AC),  735 j - 736 b and 737 j (All ER) ).   Although comparison with the
South African test will show several similarities there are plainly
differences.   The most effective illustration of that is the fact that counsel
for the appellant in Gough’s case urged the adoption of what happens to

be in virtually all respects the test in this country, having conceded
(rightly, so it was held) that there was no room for interference if the real
danger test prevailed.   He lost his case.   More particularly, the real
danger test eschews suspicion as one element and the intellectual
interposition of the reasonable person as another.   It is unnecessary for
present purposes to pursue the comparison further.   It suffices to say this.
In the main speech in Gough’s case it was remarked (at 667 H - 668 A
(AC), 735 g-h (All ER) ) —
“Since . . . the court investigates the actual
circumstances,
knowledge
of
such
circumstances as are found by the court  must
be imputed to the reasonable man; and in the
result it is difficult to see what difference there
is between the impression derived by a
reasonable man to whom such knowledge has
been imputed, and the impression derived by
the court, here personifying the reasonable
man.”

[36]     With the greatest respect I venture to say that there is an
important distinction between assessing the appearance of bias through the
eyes of a trained and experienced judicial officer and assessing it through
the eyes of a reasonable person, even with the latter’s possessing all the
relevant knowledge.   Wade and Forsyth (at 483) consider the real danger
test more objective than that which involves determining the impression
of a reasonable person.    Certainly, in eliminating the reasonable observer
the real danger test is more direct and no doubt the reasonable person,
although required to have reasonable grounds, would necessarily be
judged as viewing the events and circumstances from the subjectivity of
being, notionally, litigant or accused.   However, the real danger test may
well do no more than switch one element of subjectivity for another.   The
members of the court applying that test are by training and experience as
judicial officers themselves, better equipped, it is true, to exercise
objective judgment than a lay litigant but it is that very training and

experience which also give them a subjective position and knowledge not
possessed by the notional reasonable person.   They might know that a
judicial officer’s behaviour and comment unfortunately can, on infrequent
occasions, be inappropriate but without any real danger of bias existing.
They may more readily, therefore, in a given case regard a danger of bias
as not real where the reasonable impression of bias would nonetheless
reasonably lodge in the mind of a reasonable person suitably informed.
Essentially, the real danger test depends on the view from the Bench; the
reasonable suspicion test depends on the view from the dock.   This is
perhaps best illustrated by a statement in R v Inner West London Coroner,
ex parte Dallaglio [1994] 4 All ER 139 (CA) in which the Court of
Appeal analysed Gough’s case.   At 152 a-b it was said:
“(B)y the time the legal challenge comes to be
resolved, the court is no longer concerned
strictly with the appearance of bias but rather
with establishing the possibility that there was
actual although unconscious bias.”

Given a choice, the reasonable suspicion test accords better, in my
opinion, with the provisions and spirit of the Constitution.   It is more
conducive to acceptance by the accused or the litigants that proceedings
will in the end be fair.   And the constraining effect on those presiding
over trials and tribunals is salutary.
[37]    Turning to the application of the reasonable suspicion test to
the facts and circumstances of the present case, there can be no doubt that
the magistrate’s conduct, bearing and utterances from beginning to end of
the post-conviction proceedings would have provided the reasonable
person in the appellant’s position with eminently reasonable grounds to
think that the court might be biased.   Even by the time the recusal
application was made sufficient had occurred to create such impression.
That application was therefore wrongly refused and the “proceedings”
which followed constituted a nullity.
[38]     As to the proceedings prior to conviction, it was argued by

counsel who appeared for the State before us that there was nothing which
could have created the appearance of bias.   The conviction was not
infected by the later events and was therefore immune from interference.
That contention cannot succeed in my view.   The proper approach is to
determine whether the reasonable person in the appellant’s position would
have thought that the suspected bias might have motivated the conviction.
[39]     The fact that counsel for the appellant was not entitled after
the conviction to canvass the merits anew is not relevant. What he was
undoubtedly entitled to do was to canvass issues material to mitigation and
provocation by the complainant and the complainant’s credibility in that
regard were plainly important ones.   In that connection the medical
evidence served strongly to support the appellant and to contradict the
complainant in a vital respect.   It cast substantial doubt on the
complainant’s evidence that he struck only a single blow in fright with the
back of the hacksaw and did nothing to provoke the assault he suffered.

[40]     It is not necessary for present purposes to try to trace
procedurally the proper or likely course of proceedings had the magistrate
not acted in the irregular manner revealed by the evidence.   What is
important is that his conduct would, in my view, have caused the
reasonable person anxious and reasonable enquiry as to why the
appellant’s allegation of the hacksaw assault was rejected for no reason,
or  virtually incomprehensible reasons, in the judgment, and why all
attempts thereafter at establishing its occurrence, or at least the reasonable
possibility of its occurrence, were persistently dismissed without any
reasons save the untenable one  that counsel’s intended avenues of
investigation had nothing to do with mitigation.   Of course they did.   And
although counsel might properly have been confined to canvassing the
complainant’s credibility in that limited context, there can be little doubt
that if the complainant’s credibility suffered in that respect it would, on a
reasonable approach, have suffered, or at least been liable to suffer, in

other respects as well.   The fact that his general credibility would only
have been open to attack in an appeal is a procedural consideration which
would not have concerned the reasonable person observing the
magistrate’s post-conviction show of ostensible bias.  That person would,
in my assessment, have thought that the complainant’s credibility was
something which the magistrate was seeking, for no good apparent reason,
to protect from all criticism.   In turn that would have led to the suspicion
that the magistrate’s post-conviction conduct and attitude was evidence of
a possible bias which had persisted throughout the case and only surfaced
under the impact of counsel’s attempts to canvass the issue of provocation.
[41]     It follows that in this case there are circumstances which
compel the conclusion that the post-conviction irregularities taint the entire
trial and that the conviction cannot be allowed to stand.
[42]     The following order is made:

(a)
The appeal is allowed.

(b)
The order of the Court a quo is set aside and
substituted by the following order:
“1.
The application for review succeeds and the
conviction and sentence are set aside.
2.
By agreement, no order is made as to costs.”

JUDGMENT
MARAIS JA
MARAIS JA:

[1]     Simple sounding catch-phrases designed to capture elusive concepts in a few
easily remembered words are useful in daily discourse but they have their dangers.
They may mask the complexity of the concepts or provide a springboard for leaps
into the drawing of inaccurate or fallacious analogies.  “Contribution holiday” and
“pension fund surplus” are such catch-phrases and it is with them that this appeal
is concerned.  They owe their genesis to the phenomenon of surpluses (both
notional and real or actual) arising in pension funds.  What may legitimately be
done with such surpluses is an intensively debated topic in the pension industry.
[2]     Much as the pension industry may wish to have this court decide the many
issues which can arise in that connection, the court is not at large to do so and must
confine itself to the specific problems which arise in this case.  The answers to
those problems depend of course upon the particular facts and circumstances of the
case.  While some of this court’s conclusions may be of general application, others
will not.
[3]     There is no need to provide a detailed account of the history of the matter

and the rules of the relevant funds.  That was done by Navsa J in the court a quo.
His judgment is reported in 1998(1) SA 192 (W).  When it is necessary in order to
understand the import of what is said in the present judgment, appropriate
reference will be made to the relevant rules and circumstances.  I shall continue to
use the abbreviations of the names of the companies involved which were used in
the judgment of the court a quo.  I shall also dispense with the use of unessential
capital letters.
[4]     In the hope that jettisoning unnecessary detail will bring the problems into
sharper focus, I abbreviate the history of the funds.  The Tek Corporation Pension
Fund (1991) was established on 1 January 1991.  It is a defined benefit fund - one
which undertakes to provide its members with the benefits defined in its rules:
primarily (there are also other benefits) a pension expressed as a percentage of final
salary and based on years of service.  The rules of the fund required the employee-
members to make a recurring fixed contribution.  (Rule 4.1.1.)    The amount, if
any, to be paid by the employer had to be agreed with the fund’s trustees from time

to time but it could not be less than an amount calculated by the fund’s actuary to
be necessary to ensure the financial soundness of the fund.  (Rule 4.2.1.)  A stage
was reached when a substantial surplus existed in the fund.  A surplus in such a
fund is the amount by which the actuary’s assessment of the value of the fund’s
assets exceeds the actuary’s assessment of its liabilities.  The existence of the
surplus relieved the employer of any liability to contribute to the fund for as long
as the surplus continued to exist.  That was the inexorable effect of Rule 4.2.1.
The consequence was that as from 1 December 1991 the employer made no further
contribution to the fund.  This is what is referred to in the pension industry as
taking a “contribution holiday”.  In the context of the rules of this pension fund the
usage of  the expression may be somewhat misleading.  The word “holiday”
implies a temporary respite from duties with which one is ordinarily burdened.  It
postulates that there is an existing and enduring obligation of some kind.  In this
pension fund the effect of rule 4.2.1 is that, depending on the circumstances, the
liability of the employer to contribute may never arise and, if it does, it may be of

limited duration.  Be that as it may, the expression is convenient and I shall
continue to employ it.
[5]     In October 1992 the establishment of a defined contribution provident fund
(as opposed to a defined benefit pension fund) was mooted.  Unlike the position
in a defined benefit fund, it is inherent in a defined contribution fund that no
“surplus” can arise.  That is because there are no predetermined benefits payable.
Instead, the members are entitled to whatever the fruits (be they sweet or bitter) of
the investment of the defined contributions may prove to be.  It followed that if
such a fund was established there could be no prospect of the employer being
relieved of its obligation to contribute to the provident fund because of the
existence of a surplus in that fund.
[6]     The Tek Corporation Provident Fund was established on 1 June 1993.  The
pension fund continued to exist but over a period of time the overwhelming
majority of the pension fund’s members elected to transfer to the provident fund.
There is some dispute as to whether all of them did so but that is not of great

moment .  What is quite plain is that there would continue to be persons, especially
pensioners, for whom the pension fund would have to provide but its potential
liability would be greatly diminished.  The provident fund, on the other hand,
would have to provide for all those employees who elected to transfer to it.  The
two funds existed side by side thereafter.
[7]     Those employees who transferred from the pension to the provident fund
were required to take with them into the provident fund the actuarially assessed
value of their interest in the pension fund and they did so.  Despite that there
remained a substantial surplus in the pension fund.  It was thought that it would be
permissible in law to transfer the surplus in the pension fund to the provident fund
for use in one, or other, or both of two ways: first, to enable the employer to take
in the provident fund the “contribution holiday” which it had enjoyed in the pension
fund; secondly, to fund a stabilization account to be used to meet future cost
increases in the provision of death and disability benefits.

[8]     As a fact the surplus was not transferred to the provident fund.  However, on
the strength of advice it had been given, the employer commenced taking a
“contribution holiday” in the provident fund as from 1 November 1993.  For
reasons upon which it is unnecessary to dwell, it ultimately became common cause
that the employer had not been entitled to do so.
[9]     Consequent upon the sale of the Defy Division of the employer (Tek) to
Malbak, with effect from 1 April 1994, approximately two-thirds of the members
of the  provident fund (who had not long before transferred to that fund from the
pension fund) ceased to be employed by the Tek group and ceased to be members
of the Tek provident fund.  Instead they became members of the Malbak provident
fund taking with them into that fund “the full amount of the current credit held in
respect of each such member in terms of rule 5.1(a) and (b) of [Tek’s] provident
fund”.  (Cl 10.6 of the relevant Sale Agreement.)
[10]     It was at this stage that the erstwhile Defy/Tek (now Malbak) employees

began to question the legitimacy of the use to which Tek intended putting the
surplus which had arisen in the Tek pension fund and to advance the contention
that once the surplus in the pension fund had been transferred to the Tek provident
fund at least some of it should “follow” them into the Malbak provident fund.  The
issue was debated in an exchange of correspondence and the employees’
contention was rejected.
[11]     The position taken by the chairman of the board of trustees of both the Tek
pension fund and the Tek provident fund was quite unequivocal.  In a letter dated
3 October 1994 he said (a) that it had been their “consistent view that any surplus
existing in the pension or provident fund lies within the control of the employer
company”, (b) that there “is nothing in law (in the Pension Funds Act or elsewhere)
which requires that amounts in excess of actuarial reserves be transferred” in the
prevailing circumstances, (c) that “whatever may have been decided regarding the
application of surplus in the pension fund, there is nothing in the rules of the

provident fund which requires the trustees to pay amounts in excess of actuarial
reserves”, (d) that in comparable circumstances “it has not been the practice of the
Tek Corporation Provident Fund to transfer amounts in excess of actuarial
reserves”, and (e) that “in the absence of any formal agreement which is binding
on the provident fund, the company cannot support the transfer of amounts in
excess of actuarial reserves in respect of employees of the Defy Appliances
Division”.  In a letter dated 18 October 1994 he declined to give an “undertaking
that should the surplus be used at any time in the future for the enhancement of Tek
employee benefits Defy ex-members of the fund will benefit to a proportionate
extent”, adding that “it is our view that the surplus falls under the control of the
company and any such undertaking could potentially inhibit our access to it”.
[12]     These proceedings were then instituted on 6 September 1995 by Mr
Lorentz as a former member of both the pension and the provident fund and a
present member of the Malbak provident fund.  Because it was thought that the

surplus had already been transferred from the Tek pension fund to the provident
fund the declaratory orders claimed were attuned to that situation.  It became clear
when answering affidavits were filed and after oral evidence was given pursuant
to an appropriate order that that be done, that the surplus had not been transferred.
Indeed, the trustees and the employer had by then altered their stance substantially.
On 15 September 1995 it was decided that the pension  fund which had already
undergone one change of name should be renamed yet again due to group
restructuring as the Plessey Corporation Pension Fund.  It was now to be the fund
which all new employees in the Plessey group would be obliged to join.  The
surplus in that pension fund was to remain where it was to enable the employer to
continue enjoying the contribution holiday in that fund.  The Tek provident fund
was to continue to exist.  The amount which the employer should have contributed
to the provident fund but failed to contribute in the belief that it could use the
surplus in the pension fund to provide a contribution holiday in the provident fund,

was largely made good.
[13]     This change of stance prompted a revision of the declaratory orders sought
and Navsa J ultimately granted declaratory orders which I paraphrase thus:
(1)
An order declaring that the trustees of the pension fund are not entitled to
use the surplus in the pension fund to enable the employer to avoid paying
contributions to the provident fund “ or otherwise for the benefit of” the
employer.
(2)
An order that the trustees of the pension fund determine what portion of the
surplus is to be transferred to the provident fund pursuant to the transfer of
members of the pension fund to the provident fund;
(3)
An order that, in so determining, the trustees must have regard to
(a)
the extent of the surplus as it existed during the period
31 August 1993 to 1 November 1994, and
(b)
the returns on the investment of that surplus achieved by
the pension fund from 1 November 1994 to the date of
their determination;
(4)
An order that within two months of that determination the trustees effect
payment of the amount so determined to the provident fund;
(5)
An order that within one month of receipt of payment from the pension fund
the trustees of the provident fund must “determine the manner in which the
said funds are to be used for the purpose of increasing the benefits payable
by the provident fund” to those who became members on 31 August 1993
and other beneficiaries whose benefits are derivative - widows, children, etc;
(6)
An order that the pension fund and the provident fund pay the costs of the

application jointly and severally, including the costs of two counsel.  The
applicant (Mr Lorentz) was denied the costs attendant upon the citation of
individual trustees as parties to the application.
[14] Leave to appeal to this court was granted by the court a quo.  In essence
what the appellants would have us say, is this:
(1)
For as long as a surplus in the pension fund exists, the employer is under no
obligation to contribute to the pension fund and that is so irrespective of the
source of the surplus.  (Navsa J had held that this is so only to the extent that
the surplus is attributable to overfunding by the employer);
(2)
While such a situation exists, members and erstwhile members of the
pension fund have no right to demand that the surplus or any part of it be
used to increase the benefits payable either upon retirement or upon transfer
to another fund;
(3)
On the facts, the trustees and the employer did transfer “a sufficient and
proper” portion of the surplus to the provident fund in respect of each of the
transferring members;
(4)
The rules of the pension fund do not empower the trustees to do what the
court a quo ordered them to do;
(5)
The court a quo should have dismissed the application with an appropriate
order as to costs.
[15]     A number of propositions are either axiomatic or not in dispute.  The
pension fund, the powers and duties of its trustees, and the rights and obligations

of its members and the employer are governed by the rules of the fund, relevant
legislation and the common law.  The fund is a legal persona and owns its assets
in the fullest sense of the word “owns”.  (Sec 5(1)(a) and (b) of the Pension Funds
Act 24 of 1956.)  The object of the fund is “to provide retirement and other benefits
for employees and former employees of the employers in the event of their death”.
(Rule 1.3.)   The trustees of the fund owe a fiduciary duty to the fund and to its
members and other beneficiaries.  (Sec 2(a) and (b) of the Financial Institutions
(Investment of Funds) Act 39 of 1984 and Rule 18.1.4.)  The employer is not
similarly burdened but owes at least a duty of good faith to the fund and its
members and beneficiaries.  (Cf Imperial Group Pension Trust Ltd v Imperial
Tobacco Ltd [1991] 2 All ER 597 (Ch) at 604g - 606j.)  The rules of the fund spell
out the circumstances in which the employer must contribute to the fund and how
the quantum of the contribution is to be determined.  (Rules 4.2.1 and 19.5.)  The
existence of a surplus in this case cannot be ascribed solely to past overfunding by

the employer.  The sources of that surplus are diverse.  They have not been
identified and isolated nor have their respective contributions to the surplus been
quantified.  However, on any view of the matter, the surplus  must be attributable
at least in part to contributions  from sources other than the employer.
[16]     I move to controversial terrain.  Some preliminary observations seem
necessary.  Defined benefit pension funds do not exist to generate surpluses but
they may arise when reality and actuarial expectation do not coincide.  In assessing
the financial health of a pension fund an actuary is gazing into the proverbial crystal
ball to see what the future will hold.  The use of the metaphor is not intended to
demean the exercise; it is highly sophisticated and requires considerable training
and skill,yet it remains, when all is said and done, an exercise in prophecy.  Some
of the data available may be relatively immutable and provide a secure foundation
for predictions.  Much of it is not.  There are a host of factors about which
assumptions have to be made because they lie in the future. Examples are rates of

return upon different categories of investment, the rate of inflation, governmental
fiscal policy, increases in salary, mortality rates for active and retired members, the
rate of employee turnover, the incidence of disability, and the extent to which early
retirement options may be exercised.  The list is not exhaustive but it suffices to
show the very considerable role that assumption plays in the assessment of the
financial soundness of a pension fund and explains why even the most meticulously
assessed valuation may be confounded by subsequent experience.  While it is
obviously so that the funds necessary to ensure that the defined benefits which the
pension fund must provide are paid and will continue to be paid, are sacrosanct and
may not be used for the benefit of the employer, that is not necessarily so of funds
which are plainly surplus to that requirement.  I say “plainly” advisedly because the
existence of a surplus at any particular point in the history of a fund may be so
potentially transitory that it would be imprudent to diminish the fund by eliminating
the surplus.

[17]     It has often been argued that in a situation like the present (sometimes
described as “balance of cost” pension schemes) where the employer is the ultimate
guarantor of the financial soundness of the fund, any surplus should enure to its
benefit as the members of the fund carry no risk in that regard.  The contention
seems to me to be unduly simplistic but whatever its merits (if any) may be in
equity, it begs the question whether any such entitlement exists in law.  As Warner
J observed in Mettoy Pension Trustees Ltd v Evans [1991] 2 All ER 513 (Ch)
at 551b “One cannot in my opinion, in construing the rules of a ‘balance of cost’
pension scheme relating to surplus, start from an assumption that any surplus
belongs morally to the employer.”  Once a surplus arises it is ipso facto an integral
component of the fund.  Unless the employer can point to a relevant rule of the fund
or statutory enactment or principle of the common law which confers such
entitlement or empowers the trustees to use the surplus for its benefit, the employer
has no right in law to the surplus.  It goes without saying that whatever negotiations

may be taking place behind the scenes to cater for such situations by way of
legislation, as has been done in some other countries, this court can judge the
matter only in accordance with existing law.  In Schmidt v Air Products Canada
Ltd [1994] 2 SCR 611 Cory J, writing for the majority, said:  “Regrettably a
comprehensive approach to the issues arising from pension surplus has yet to be
enacted in any part of this country.  The courts have on a number of occasions been
required to determine the allocation of pension surplus.  Yet the courts are limited
in their approach by the necessity of applying the sometimes inflexible principles
of contract and trust law.  The question of entitlement to surplus raises issues
involving both social policy and taxation policy.  The broad policy issues which are
raised by surplus disputes would be better resolved by legislation than by a case-
by-case consideration or individual plans.  Yet that is what now must be
undertaken.”  (At 652d - e)   I echo those sentiments.
[18]     It was not suggested that there is any principle of the common law which

would enable the employer to lay claim to a surplus arising in the way in which this
one did, either during the life of the fund or upon its liquidation.  Nor am I aware
of any such principle.  There is no relevant statutory enactment which confers such
a claim.  What is left are the rules of the pension fund.  To those I now turn.
[19     The first point worthy of note is that there is nothing in the rules which
explicitly entitles the employer to lay claim to a surplus either during the life of the
fund or upon its liquidation.  Yet it is plain that the possibility of a surplus arising
was contemplated.  Rule 19.5.1 requires an actuarial valuation of the fund to be
made at intervals not exceeding three years.   Rule 19.5.2 reads:
“If the valuation discloses that there is a substantial actuarial surplus or that
there is a deficit that requires to be funded, the manner of dealing with the
surplus or funding the deficit shall be considered by the trustees and
recommendations made to the principal employer for a decision.  The
principal employer’s decision shall be made within the limitations imposed
by the [Pension Funds] Act and the Registrar’s practice and shall be final.
Where necessary, the trustees shall alter the rules to give effect to such
decision.”
[20]     This provision appears to be the only one in the rules which deals expressly

with a possible surplus.  A number of features strike one.  The rule is to operate
only where a substantial surplus exists.  The same rule governs a deficit but the
deficit need not be substantial.  It seems reasonably clear that the rule contemplates
valuations made during the continuing existence of the fund  and provides for what
is to happen where substantial surpluses or deficits arise while the fund continues
to exist.  It does not appear to be aimed at dealing with surpluses or deficits arising
upon liquidation.  There are other rules dealing pertinently with the realization of
the assets of the fund and the apportionment of the proceeds after payment of all
liquidation expenses.  (Rules 16.1 and 16.2.) It is significant that any balance then
remaining must go to members, pensioners and other beneficiaries on an equitable
basis recommended by the fund’s actuary and approved by the liquidator.  No part
of it goes to the employer.  Indeed, the employer has no say at all in the process.
[21]     During the continuance of the fund the employer is certainly accorded a
good deal of say by rule 19.5.2 but there are limits to it. The limitations imposed

seem to me to be designed to ensure that the objects of the fund are realized.  Why
else would the trustees have to play a role by making appropriate recommendations
and the power of the employer be made subject to the limitations of the Pension
Funds Act and the Registrar’s practice?  It is difficult to reconcile those provisions
with any suggestion that the employer is free to take a decision which is solely in
its own interests but not that of the fund and its members.  If it had been intended
to confer upon the employer an unfettered power to do what it liked with an
identified surplus, I would have expected the framers of the rules to say so clearly
and unambiguously.  In so far as it was contended in the pre-litigation
correspondence that any surplus “lies within the control of the employer company”
in the sense  that the employer has uninhibited access to it, I consider the
contention to be wrong.
[22]     That does not mean that the employer can derive no benefit whatsoever
from the existence of a surplus.  A recommendation by trustees that a surplus be

retained to counter a perceived risk of future adverse volatility in the investment
environment, if accepted by the employer, will benefit the employer in as much as
it will not be liable to make contributions to the fund for so long as the surplus
exists.  But that would be a fortuitous and incidental advantage flowing from a
recommendation made by the trustees in the interests of the fund and its members.
In so recommending the trustees would not be acting in breach of their fiduciary
duties nor would they be acting ultra vires.  Nor would the employer be acting in
bad faith towards its employees in accepting the recommendation.
[23]     While on this topic it would be as well to correct a misconception which led
Navsa J to hold that it was not permissible for the employer to avoid making
contributions by reliance upon the existence of a surplus save to the extent that  the
surplus was attributable to past overcontribution from the employer.  With respect
to the learned judge, I do not think that is correct.  It overlooks the distinction
between a defined benefit scheme in which the employer’s contribution is fixed and

must be paid irrespective of the state of the fund, and a scheme like the present  in
which it is not and liability to contribute arises only when it is necessary in the
estimation of the fund’s actuary to ensure the financial soundness of the fund.   In
the former class of case there is an existing and continuing liability to contribute
and using the existence of a surplus to avoid the making of contributions could not
be justified.  In the latter class of case, of which the present is an example, there is
no predetermined and continuing liability to contribute.  The liability arises only
when need arises.  Present a surplus, absent a need and absent a liability.  The
employer is therefore not being relieved of a liability and is receiving no benefit to
the detriment of the fund or its members.  It  is  irrelevant  how  the surplus arose
and whether or not it is attributable to overcontribution in the past by the employer.
There is simply no liability to contribute in such circumstances.
[24]     It is another matter whether the employer is entitled to insist upon the
trustees preserving a surplus even if only to allow it to take or prolong a

contribution holiday.  Rule 11.1 empowers the trustees “to review the level of
pensions being paid from the fund and [they] may direct that pensions be
increased”.  It provides that the “amount of the increase shall be determined by the
trustees in consultation with the ................. employer and the actuary”.  It is far
from clear to me that the imposition of the obligation to consult with the employer
as to the amount of any increase is tantamount to conferring upon the employer a
power of veto which would enable it to prevent the trustees from directing that any
increase at all be given.  It may be, I express no opinion on it, that the employer
may legitimately require the trustees not to exhaust a surplus to such an extent that
an easily foreseeable deficit will arise in future which will render the employer
liable to contribute to the fund.  But that is a far cry from accepting that the
employer can dictate to the trustees that a substantial surplus be kept intact purely
to insure it against any potential future liability to contribute to the fund.  Insistence
on that being done in the face of a financially rational and well motivated

recommendation from the trustees that, for example, pensions being paid be
increased, in circumstances in which that would not have the effect of triggering the
employer’s liability to contribute, would not be consistent with the good faith which
the employer is required to show towards its employees.
[25]     Rule 16.4 also has some bearing upon the question of whether or not the
employer is entitled to the benefit of a surplus.  That rule caters for the case where
the employer ceases to be liable to contribute to the fund as a result of a decision
to establish, or participate in, another pension fund.  No liquidation of the former
fund takes place.  Instead, the trustees “shall cause the assets .......... to be
transferred to the other ........... fund”.  Again, there is no provision for a refund to
the employer if a surplus exists in the former fund.
[26]     The focus thus far has been upon the question of whether, and if so, to what
extent, the employer is entitled to benefit from the surplus in the pension fund.  I
turn to the question of what the employees’ rights in respect of the surplus are.  It

was common cause that rule 11.1 authorises the trustees to increase only “pensions
being paid from the fund” and that it does not authorise any generally applicable
increase in pension benefits payable to active members upon their retirement in
terms of rule 5.1.   Indeed, one looks in vain for any provision in the rules of the
fund which would authorise an increase of the latter kind.  Counsel were agreed
that rule 11.2 appears to authorise only ad hoc increases in benefits payable to
particular individuals.  An appropriate amendment of the rules would be necessary
and that cannot be achieved without the consent of the employer.  (Rule 21.1.)
[27]     It is the dearth of appropriate provisions in the rules to govern the situation
which arose in this case which, in my view, places an insuperable obstacle in the
way of upholding the orders numbered (2), (3), (4) and (5) in paragraph [13].  That
lacuna seems to me to destroy the contention that the trustees are bound to transfer
from the pension fund an appropriate portion of the surplus to the provident fund.
It disables one  from accommodating within any of the existing rules of the pension

fund that which the court a quo was persuaded to order to be done in that
connection.
[28]     An unavoidable consequence of the absence of appropriate provisions was
that counsel for respondent were constrained to rest their argument upon what they
described as analogous provisions in the rules which, so it was said, gave “an
indication” as to what should be done in this admittedly different situation.  In my
opinion there are serious conceptual difficulties in the way of such an approach.
What the trustees may do with the fund’s assets is set forth in the rules.  If what
they propose to do (or have been ordered to do) is not within the powers conferred
upon them by the rules, they may not do it.  They have no inherent and unlimited
power as trustees to deal with a surplus as they see fit, notwithstanding their
fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the members and beneficiaries of the
fund.  It may seem odd to speak of powers being beyond the reach of the trustees
and the employer when the rules empower them to amend the rules but the

contradiction is more apparent than real.  First, their substantive powers at any
given moment are circumscribed by the rules as they are at that moment.  The fact
that power to change the rules exists is irrelevant when assessing whether or not the
particular exercise of power in question was intra or ultra vires.  Secondly, there
are a number of qualifications in both the rules and the Pension Funds Act to the
exercise of the rule amending power conferred by rule 21.  It is unnecessary to spell
them out; it is sufficient to say that the trustees and the employer do not enjoy
absolute autonomy in that regard.
[29]     Let me recall the essentials of what happened here.  The surplus in the
pension fund existed.   On the strength of it the employer had taken a contribution
holiday.  A new and different fund was created - the provident fund.  Most, if not
all, of the pension fund’s members transferred to it but the pension fund was not
liquidated.  It continued to exist side by side with the provident fund and so did its
obligations towards those who were already on pension and those members who

did not transfer to the provident fund.  The employer’s potential liability to
contribute to the pension fund remained.  Had it been liquidated in terms of rules
16.1 and 16.2 as a consequence of any of the circumstances therein set forth having
arisen, it would have been clear what would have had to be done with the assets of
the fund.  Rule 16.2 is quite explicit: “the liquidator shall realise the assets of the
fund and, after payment of all expenses incurred in liquidating the fund, apportion
the proceeds amongst the active members, pensioners and other beneficiaries on an
equitable basis recommended by the actuary and approved by the liquidator”.
Provision is also made for the inclusion in the apportionment of some former
members. The details are not important.  What is important is that the employer
would have had no claim to participate in the apportionment whether or not a
surplus existed, and that the employees’ rights would have depended upon what
apportionment was made in terms of rule 16.2.
[30]     Had the circumstances catered for in rule 16.4 arisen, the position would

have been equally clear.  That rule provides that if the employer’s contributions are
terminated by the giving to the trustees of the written notice of termination which
rule 16.1 empowers the employer to give, and that is “the result of a decision to
establish, or participate in, another approved pension fund then the fund shall not
be liquidated ....... but the trustees shall cause the assets of the fund to be
transferred to the other approved pension fund”.  Again, the employer would have
had no claim to any part of those assets which would have included of course the
surplus.  Equally, the employees who were members of the former fund would not
have been entitled to require the trustees to do anything with the surplus other than
to transfer it to the “other approved pension fund”.  What their rights would have
been thereafter would have depended of course upon the rules of the “other
approved pension fund”.
[31]      None of the provisions in the pension fund’s rules prior to their amendment
as a consequence of the decision to establish a provident fund could accommodate

what the employees required, and Navsa J ordered, to be done with the surplus.
The question which has next to be considered is whether any of the amendments
altered the position.  I leave out of account those which have no relevance.
[32]     Amendment No 4 was effective from 30 September 1992.  It added to Rule
3 two additional provisions to take account of the situation which arose when T I
Technologies (Pty) Ltd (“TIT”) ceased to be a subsidiary of Tek.  The employees
of TIT were given the option of becoming members of a newly established
provident fund and of having their “accumulated contributions  ....... in the service
of TIT” transferred to an approved pension or retirement annuity fund or into the
provident fund for their benefit.  This was what was later described as the
“withdrawal benefit”.   Rule 3.2 bis went on to provide that an “amount determined
by the trustees on the advice of the actuary to be the rest, after deduction of the
members’ withdrawal benefit mentioned above, of the reserve value (if any) of the
members’ accrued pension benefit shall be transferred to the provident fund to be

applied in terms of the provident fund rules”.  Rule 3.2 ter catered for the TIT
employees who did not opt to join the newly established provident fund.  They
were given the choice of having the “reserve value of [their] accrued pension
benefit, as determined by the actuary” transferred to one or other of three named
funds.  The rule concluded with a paragraph stating that once payment had been
made in terms of rule 3.2 bis or 3.2 ter, the fund’s “liability to the members
mentioned shall be discharged and they will have no claim against the fund”.
[33]     This amendment is significant for two reasons.  First, it accords nobody,
either departing members of the Tek pension fund or the employer, rights in any
surplus which might then have existed in the fund.  Secondly, it complicates the
issues before the court because the orders granted by Navsa J failed to take the
position of those employees into account.  If those orders were justified in respect
of the other employees, it may well be that the TIT employees should not have been
excluded from any participation in the surplus. Those employees are  not before the

court and it would not be right to make pronouncements affecting them without
having heard what they might have to say.  However that may be, the conclusion
to which I have come regarding the correctness or otherwise of the orders granted
by Navsa J makes it unnecessary to pursue the point.
[34]     Amendment No 5 came into effect on 1 June 1993.  It came about because
of the establishment of the Tek provident fund.  Certain “Special Provisions” were
added to the rules.  They gave active members of the pension fund the option of
remaining active members of the fund or of becoming members of the provident
fund.  Those who elected to join the provident fund ceased to be members of the
pension fund.  For the rest the provisions of amendment No 5 were much the same
as those of amendment No 4 save that there was no express exclusion of any other
claim against the fund.
[35]     I shall return later to amendment No 6.  Amendment No 5 was itself
amended by amendment No 7 with effect from 1 June 1993.  What the amendment

did was to make it possible for the trustees, in consultation with the actuary, to
transfer to the provident fund in the case of each active member who elected to join
it “such additional amount (if any) as the trustees, in consultation with the actuary,
shall determine; to be applied under the provident fund in terms of the rules of that
fund”.  While this amendment might at first blush appear to authorise use of a
surplus to increase the benefits to which employees would become entitled upon
retirement (prompting counsel for respondent to describe it as “serendipitous”), in
fact it did not.
[36]     The reason is this.  Any such “additional amount” which might be
transferred to the provident fund had “to be applied under the provident fund in
terms of the rules of that fund”.  A corresponding and contemporaneous amendment
of rule 4.2 of the provident fund required such amount to be credited to Reserve
Account No 2 and for there to be deducted from that account “such amounts
........... as are required to meet the employer’s contribution in terms of rule 4.1 until

such time as the amount standing to the credit of Reserve Account No 2 is
exhausted”. The trustees were also authorised to use part of the amount standing
to the credit of that account to meet “the expenses of the fund”.  In short, the
dominant purpose of the amendments was to enable the employer to do what it now
concedes it was unlawful to do, namely, to use the surplus in the pension fund to
finance the contributions which it was obliged to make to the provident fund.  They
were not intended to confer, nor are they capable of being interpreted as conferring,
upon the trustees of the pension fund the power to do what respondent would have
them do and what Navsa J has ordered them to do.
[37]     Amendment No 6 took effect from 1 March 1993.  It gave wage earning
active members the option of transferring to the Metal Industries Provident Fund
or remaining as members of the pension fund.  A member transferring ceased to be
a member of the pension fund and became entitled to a lump sum benefit equal to
his or her actuarial reserve as determined by the actuary as at the date of his or her

withdrawal from the pension fund.  That sum (after payment of income tax) had to
be transferred to the Metal Industries Provident Fund to be applied under that fund
in terms of its rules.  The complications which amendment No 4 creates for the
orders granted by Navsa J arise again here for similar reasons.
[38]     With the wisdom of hindsight one can see what went wrong when the issue
of establishing a provident fund and what should be done about the surplus in the
pension fund arose.  The premise upon which the matter was approached, namely,
that the fate of the surplus was entirely in the hands of the employer, was incorrect.
The trustees of the pension fund and the employer failed to appreciate that it was
incorrect.  The misconception permeated the drafting of the amendments discussed
earlier and diverted attention from the real question  which was how to resolve the
issue of the surplus to the satisfaction of all. Because the existing rules of the fund
did not cover the situation which it was sought to create, a mutually satisfactory
solution should have been negotiated and the rules amended accordingly.  That

would have required consensus to be reached between employer, trustees and
employees.  Failing consensus, there would have been stalemate and the surplus
would have had to remain where it was - in the pension fund.  Whether or not the
provident fund would have been created none the less it is not possible to say.  The
employer asserts that it would not and perhaps that is so but the fact of the matter
is that it now exists.
[39]     The present situation is probably satisfactory to nobody.  The employer
cannot benefit from the surplus in the pension fund save in the limited sense which
I have explained earlier (prolongation of the contribution holiday in the pension
fund).  The employees who have transferred to the provident fund have no existing
access to the surplus in the pension fund.  The only persons who might benefit from
its existence during the life of the pension fund are those already on pension (or
their dependants).   Their benefits could conceivably be increased under rule 11.1.
A return to the drawing board appears to be the only way in which the

unsatisfactory aspects of the situation can be resolved.
[40]     There is little point in reviewing and discussing the other cases in foreign
jurisdictions to which this court was referred.  They are certainly informative and
helpful in a general sense but in the end the answers to the questions which arise
in this case must be found in the rules of this particular pension fund and the law
of South Africa.  To the extent that anything said in the unreported decision in
Sauls v Ford South Africa Pension Fund and Others (Case No 1878/87 South
Eastern Cape Local Division) (and tentatively approved in another unreported
decision of the High Court of Namibia in Rössing Pension Fund v Lyners and
Others, 20 November 1996) is inconsistent with the conclusions reached in this
case, it should be regarded as overruled.
[41]     It seems advisable to deal with a particular contention advanced by
appellants which may surface again if there is further litigation in this dispute.  It
was that the registrar’s approval in terms of sec 14(1) of the Pension Funds Act of

what was done when the provident fund was created and some of the assets of the
pension fund were transferred to it precludes the court from entertaining
respondent’s claims unless the registrar’s certificate given pursuant to sec 14(1)(e)
is set aside on review.  I do not agree.  The registrar’s certificate is predicated upon
an intra vires and properly taken decision by the trustees of the fund.  If the
decision of the trustees is open to attack because it is ultra vires or because it has
not been properly arrived at, the registrar’s certificate cannot save it.
[42]     The upshot of all this remains to be stated.  I refer to the orders of the court
a quo by the numbers assigned to them in paragraph [13] of this judgment.
Order (1):     Given the intransigent insistence of the trustees and the employer
prior to the institution of these proceedings that the employer alone was entitled to
decide what would be done with the surplus, and given the subsequent retention in
the rules of the relevant funds of amendments purporting to authorise the use of the
surplus in the pension fund to meet the employer’s obligations to the provident fund

even after the disavowal of any intention to do so, the granting of an order
specifically prohibiting its use for the purpose cannot be criticised.  The belated
change of stance by appellants in that regard and the concessions made for the first
time in the papers were not, in my view, sufficient to disentitle respondent to such
an order.  The extension of the order to prohibit the use of the surplus “otherwise
for the benefit of” the employer is another matter.  I consider that to have been too
sweeping in its compass.  It would prevent the employer from taking a contribution
holiday in even the pension fund (save to the extent that its own payments had
contributed to the surplus).  For the reasons given earlier, that limitation is not
justified.
[43]     Orders (2), (3), (4) and (5):  These require the trustees to act in ways in
which they are not empowered to act under the existing rules of the pension fund.
They should not have been made.
[44]     Order (6):  The costs order was the consequence of respondent’s success

on virtually all fronts before the court a quo.  It requires revision in the light of this
court’s conclusions.
[45]     To revert to the contentions advanced by appellant and which are listed and
numbered in paragraph [14] of this judgment:
(1) is correct; (2) requires considerable qualification; (3) is an assertion which
cannot be made in the circumstances; (4) is correct; (5) does not necessarily follow.
[46]     Ad (2):  It is so that during the continuance of the pension fund its members
cannot demand that the surplus be used to increase the benefits payable upon
retirement.  Whether or not they may require the surplus to be transferred to
another fund upon their transfer to that fund will depend upon the circumstances
giving rise to the transfer.  For example, a transfer in the circumstances postulated
in rule 16.4 would require the assets of the fund (which would include the surplus)
to be transferred because the rule so provides.  A transfer not catered for by any of
the rules could not take place without the concurrence of the members and what is

to happen to the surplus would have to  be negotiated with the employer and the
trustees and appropriate amendments to the rules would have to be made to enable
the trustees to give effect to the consensus reached.
[47]     In so doing account would have to be taken of sec 14(1)(c) of the Pension
Funds Act which deprives a transfer of any force unless the registrar is satisfied
inter alia that the scheme “accords full recognition to the rights and reasonable
benefit expectations of the persons concerned in terms of the rules of a fund
concerned”.  What is comprehended by the expression “reasonable benefit
expectations” is not easy to say.  Plainly it must mean something over and above
the defined benefits to which the persons mentioned are entitled.  Periodic inflation
related increases in payments to existing pensioners may be an example.  But it is
a huge step from there to the bold proposition that whatever the size of a surplus
may be, and however it may have come about, members and erstwhile members of
a fund are reasonably entitled to expect that it, or most of it, will be applied in such

a way as to give them benefits substantially greater than those to which they are
entitled as of right.  It is a step which I am not prepared to take.  Before any
sensible view could be formed as to whether or not an expectation is reasonable
one would need to know a good deal more about such things as the state of the
existing fund, its potential liabilities, the history and sources of the surplus, the
respective contributions of the members and the employer to it, and so on.
[48]     Ad (3):  It is not possible to say whether or not “a sufficient and proper”
portion of the surplus was transferred to the provident fund.  It is so that when the
transfer to the provident fund from the pension fund took place some additional
benefits were conferred but the fact remains that the decisions to do so were made
while the trustees and the employer were under a misapprehension as to the extent
of the employer’s power to decide what should be done with the surplus.  Had they
been aware of the true position and not misdirected themselves in that regard they
may well have decided upon other courses of action in order to deal with the

surplus.  It certainly cannot be confirmed, as counsel for appellants invited this
court to do, that what was done in that regard amounted to “a sufficient and proper”
discharge by them of their obligations in regard to the surplus.  As against that,
what respondent requires to be done is beyond the existing power of the trustees.
It may well be that there is other relief to which respondent would have been
entitled as a consequence of the fundamental misconception under which the
employer, the trustees, and their advisers laboured in reaching the decisions which
were reached but that is not the question before us.  The question is whether the
relief sought and granted was correctly granted.
[49]     Ad (5):  For the reasons given in paragraph [42] I consider that respondent
was entitled to some of the relief which he sought in the court a quo.  While it is
so that he should not have been granted all the relief which he sought, he has
succeeded also in having declared as wrong in law the premise upon which the
trustees and the employer relied, namely, that the power of disposition in respect

of the surplus lay solely with the employer.  As against that, appellants were
entitled to resist being ordered to do what they were ordered to do in terms of
paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) and their resistance should have been successful.
Those orders related to issues which were central to the litigation and the
appellants’ successful resistance of them should be reflected in the costs orders
which should have been made by the court a quo.  The limited respects in which
respondent was entitled to succeed in the court a quo related to matters which were
really no longer in dispute after the filing of appellants’ answering affidavits and the
subsequent phases of the litigation were devoted essentially to those aspects of the
matter in respect of which appellants should have been successful and respondent
unsuccessful.  Costs are of course a matter of judicial discretion and this court is
obliged to make the costs order which it considers would have been appropriate if
the court a quo had reached the conclusions which this court has reached.  I
consider that it would be fair to order first, sixth and seventh appellants to pay

respondent’s costs in the court a quo up to and including the stage at which it was
ordered that oral evidence be heard, and to order respondent to pay appellants’
costs thereafter.
[50]      The costs of appeal stand on a different footing.  Appellants have enjoyed
substantial success on appeal.  Important orders made by the court a quo have been
set aside and some significant misconceptions rectified.  Respondent persisted in
defending the grant of those orders.  Appellants on the other hand persisted in the
claim that the entire application should have been dismissed with costs.
Respondent has been successful in resisting that claim.  In the circumstances the
respective measures of success should receive some measure of recognition in the
costs order.  I think that respondent should be ordered to pay three-quarters of
appellants’ costs of appeal.
[51]     In the result, it is ordered that the appeal be upheld to the following extent:
(1)
The orders of the court a quo are set aside and substituted by the
following orders:

(a)
It is declared that the trustees of sixth respondent (Tek
Corporation Pension Fund (1991), now renamed Plessey
Corporation Pension Fund) are not lawfully entitled to
make use of the surplus in the fund for the purpose of
permitting seventh respondent (Tek Corporation
Limited, now renamed Plessey SA Limited) to reduce,
diminish or avoid its obligation to make contributions to
first respondent (Tek Corporation Provident Fund)
pursuant to rule 4.1 of the rules of first respondent,
being annexure “AA” to the replying affidavit of
applicant;
(b)
For the rest, the application is dismissed.
(c)
First, sixth and seventh respondents are ordered to pay
applicant’s costs, including the costs of two counsel, but
excluding any costs attendant upon the citation of
individual trustees as parties, up to and including the
stage at which it was ordered that oral evidence be
heard.
(d)
Applicant is ordered to pay respondents’ costs,
including the costs of two counsel, incurred thereafter.
(2)
Respondent is ordered to pay three-quarters of appellants’ costs of
appeal, including the costs of two counsel.

JUDGMENT
_________________________________________________________

SMALBERGER, GROSSKOPF JJA and MPATI AJA:
This is an application for leave to adduce further
evidence.
The three applicants, Messrs Boy Titi Ndweni, Sipiwe James Bholo
and Sipho Samuel Gavin, were convicted on 20 June 1994 in the
Transvaal Provincial Division by Curlewis J and two assessors of three
counts of murder and various other charges, all arising from the same
incident.  The second and third applicants were sentenced to death on
each of the three murder counts (since reduced to life imprisonment); in
respect of the remaining charges they were both sentenced to substantial
periods of imprisonment.  The first applicant was sentenced to an effective
sentence of 17 years imprisonment on all the counts.  The applicants were
refused leave to appeal by the learned judge a quo with regard to those

convictions and sentences where they did not have an automatic right of
appeal.  In a very belated application to this Court, following on events to
be outlined below, the applicants sought and were granted condonation,
leave to appeal against their aforementioned convictions and sentences
and confirmation of their right to seek leave to adduce further evidence.
The incident concerned occurred at Eikenhof on the morning of 19
March 1993 when a group of persons who had hijacked a BMW vehicle
and compelled its owner, Mr Nelson Mpunge (“Mpunge”), to transport
them to Eikenhof, fired upon the five occupants of a stationary vehicle,
killing three and wounding two of them (“the Eikenhof attack”).  Two of
the persons killed, and one of the wounded, were schoolchildren on their
way to school.  At their subsequent trial, at which the essential issue was
the identity of the attackers, the applicants were held to be the persons

responsible.  The main evidence against them comprised (1) confessions
made by the first and second applicants which were found to have been
freely and voluntarily made, and (2) their identification as the perpetrators
by certain witnesses of whom Mpunge was the main one.  Their alibi
defences were rejected by the court a quo.  There was no other evidence
linking them to the attack.
It is common cause that the three applicants have at all relevant
times been members of the African National Congress (“the ANC”).  On
22 July 1997, more than four years after the incident, and three years after
the applicants’ convictions, the Azanian People’s Liberation Army
(“APLA”) issued a press statement claiming responsibility for the
Eikenhof attack.  Subsequent enquiries made on the applicants’ behalf
revealed that an APLA member, Mr Phila Martin Dolo (“Dolo”) had

submitted applications for amnesty to the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (“the TRC”) in December 1996 and February 1997.  In the
latter application he claimed that, in addition to other acts, “I also ordered
the Eikenhof ambush where three people were killed”.  This was
subsequently confirmed by Dolo in an affidavit made by him to the
applicants’ legal advisers on 24 November 1997. In the affidavit Dolo
claims that the Eikenhof attack was carried out by a group of four trained
APLA members and that he subsequently received reports from them,
including two written reports, relating to the attack.  None of the persons
named by Dolo (by their code names) has come forward and made an
affidavit.  However, it is claimed on the papers that one of them, Mr Sipho
Polite Xuma, also known as Bulelani Xuma (“Xuma”), has telephonically
confirmed his involvement to the applicants’ attorney, although it is

alleged by the respondent that he has since denied any participation in the
attack.  The above and other considerations, some of which we shall
allude to in due course, have given rise to the present application.  The
relief sought, on which there is no need to elaborate, is cast in wide terms
and involves the calling or re-calling of a number of specified witnesses.
Amongst them are Dolo and Xuma.
It is not in the interests of the administration of justice that issues
of fact, once judicially investigated and pronounced upon, should lightly
be re-opened and amplified (S v De Jager 1965(2) SA 612 (A) at 613 A -
B).  An applicant seeking to re-open a case and lead further evidence will
generally be required to satisfy the following requirements:
“(a)
There should be some reasonably sufficient
explanation, based on allegations which may be true,
why the evidence which it is sought to lead was not
led at the trial.

(b)
There should be a prima facie likelihood of the truth
of the evidence.
(c)
The evidence should be materially relevant to the
outcome of the trial.”
(See S v De Jager (supra) at 613 C - D.)
We do not propose to analyse, or comment upon, the wealth of
material placed before us in support of, or in opposition to, the
application, much of which is in the nature of hearsay.  It would be both
unwise and undesirable for us to express a view on disputed and
contentious matters which are incapable of resolution on the papers.  It
will suffice, for present purposes, to set out certain facts which, unless
otherwise indicated, are either common cause or not seriously in dispute.
They are:
1)
Mpunge testified at the trial that the persons involved in the
Eikenhof attack told him to “report [to] the police that they are APLA and

that they will strike again”.
2)
As pointed out earlier, the applicants are members of the ANC;
APLA is the military wing of the Pan Africanist Congress (“the PAC”).
3)
The ANC and PAC are (and were at the time) different and distinct
political groupings.  Although sharing certain common goals they were
generally in opposition to each other.
4)
Five prospective witnesses who were in the immediate vicinity of
where the shooting occurred made sworn statements to the police between
one to four days after the event.  Three of them, Bennie Schoonwyk
(“Bennie”), Piti (or Pietie) Mthembu (“Piti”) and Yvonne Msimango
(“Yvonne”) were school children aged 15, 14 and 16 years respectively.
The other two were Mrs Regina Bonose (“Bonose”) and her husband Mr
Joseph Nkosi (“Nkosi”).  Bennie, Piti and Yvonne were each individually

shown a set of approximately 300 photographs and each one
independently identified from them the same two persons as being
amongst the attackers.  The persons they identified were Xuma and Mr
Muzi William Motha (“Motha”).  Both Xuma and Motha were known to
the police as APLA members.  Although there is some dispute in this
regard, it would seem that from a set of six photographs shown to them,
Bonose identified Motha as one of the attackers while Nkosi stated that
he (Motha) resembled one of them. All five persons failed at later
identification parades to point out any of the applicants who were present
on such parades.
5)
In December 1994 Dolo was convicted of murder and various other
offences arising out of an attack on two policemen at Diepkloof and
sentenced, inter alia, to life imprisonment.  A variant of an AK-47 rifle

was used in the attack.  On 30 July 1997 Captain Brits, a ballistics expert
with the South African Police Services, found on testing that the weapon
in question had also been used in the Eikenhof attack.
6)
As previously mentioned, Dolo claimed in his amnesty application
in February 1997 that he had ordered the Eikenhof attack; and on 22 July
1997 APLA publicly claimed responsibility for the attack.  Yet as far back
as May 1995 two “secret reports” relating to the Eikenhof attack,
purporting to be written by APLA members, were seized by members of
the South African Police Services in a raid on a so-called “safe house”
used by APLA members.  Doubts have been raised on the papers as to the
authenticity of these reports.  It is now conceded that the reports are in
Dolo’s handwriting, but he apparently claims to have copied them from
the original reports submitted to him, which he then destroyed.  This was

done, according to him, for security reasons.  However, what is beyond
dispute is that the reports were already in existence in 1995, more than 18
months before the first claim of APLA’s involvement was made.
7)
Preliminary security police reports compiled after the Eikenhof
attack concluded that APLA was to blame for the attack.  In later reports,
however, a different conclusion was reached.
8)
In the course of an enquiry into the claims made by APLA
conducted by a Deputy Attorney-General, Mr Anton Ackermann, Mpunge
(whose evidence of identification at the trial revealed some confusion) on
27 August 1997 made a further statement in which, while abiding by his
original statement, he alleged the following:
“I went to two (2) ID-parades.  Before the first ID-parade a
photograph of Mr Dawid Mokoena was shown to me by a
white police official and the police official told me that this
is the man that hi-jacked my car and I must go to the ID-

parade to point out the man on the photograph on the ID-
parade.  I went to the ID-parade and pointed the man out.
This man was later released by the police.
5.
Before the second ID-parade a white police official showed
photographs of Siphiwe Bholo and Boy Titi Ndweni to me
and asked me if I knew them.  I said no.  He told me that the
two (2) persons on the photographs confessed that they were
involved in the Eikenhof incident and that I must go to the
ID-parade and point the two (2) persons out.  I went to the
ID-parade and pointed the above-mentioned two (2) persons
out.”
In a later statement made on 21 May 1998 he retracted these allegations
and denied that any photographs had ever been shown to him.
In essence the applicants seek to re-open their trial and lead further
evidence (including recalling certain witnesses who have already testified)
with regard to whether they, or APLA members instructed thereto by
Dolo, were responsible for the Eikenhof attack.  The evidence they seek

to lead satisfies requirements (a) and (c) in De Jager’s case (supra).  The
common cause facts listed in paras 5, 6, 7 and 8 above, which are
materially relevant to the ultimate outcome of the trial, only came to light
after the conclusion of the trial.  The facts referred to in para 4 were
known to the prosecuting authorities at the time of the trial.  The
witnesses who were not called by the State were made available to the
defence.  The fact that at the time APLA had not yet claimed
responsibility coupled with an apparent lack of knowledge or appreciation
on the part of defence counsel that at least three of the witnesses had
pointed out photographs of the same persons, and that these were APLA
members, provides a reasonably sufficient explanation for the matter not
having been pursued to the full by defence counsel.  What is important,
in our view, is that the facts referred to in para 4 should have been brought

to the attention of the trial court.  Whether anyone was at fault in not
doing so is something on which we prefer not to comment as the full facts
concerning the matter are not available to us.
Requirement (b) in De Jager’s case remains to be satisfied.  One
would normally be sceptical of a claim of responsibility first made nearly
four years after the event in circumstances potentially non-prejudicial to
its maker (because he is already serving a maximum gaol sentence and has
a pending amnesty application).  More particularly this would be so
where, as is evident from the papers, such claim is (at least in some
measure) subject to conflicting reports, characterised by vagueness and
inconsistency, open to serious challenge and, furthermore, is unconfirmed
on oath by any of the alleged participants in the Eikenhof attack.
However, we are not called upon to decide at this stage whether Dolo’s

claims are true or not.  In S v Steyn 1981(4) SA 385(C), Marais AJ, after
an exhaustive review of the relevant authorities, came to the conclusion
that the test of “a prima facie likelihood of the truth of the evidence”
meant no more than that, in a matter such as the present, the evidence
tendered should prima facie reasonably possibly be true (at 392 H).
There is much to be said for the correctness of that approach.  Whether
that is the test, or the correct test is somewhat more stringent is a matter
we need not decide.  In our view, if proper regard is had to the effect on
the evidence which the common cause or undisputed facts we have listed,
taken cumulatively, may (not necessarily will) have when it comes to
finally weighing up probabilities, drawing inferences and assessing
credibility, the test would be satisfied in either instance.  In any event, and
without elaborating, there are special features present arising from the

unusual circumstances of this matter which would justify, by way of
exception, the re-opening of the case.  (Cf S v Myende 1985(1) SA 805
(A) at 811 E - F.)  The dictates of fairness require that all relevant
information bearing on the applicants’ guilt or innocence should be before
the trial court to enable it to determine the true facts, lest there be an
injustice either to the applicants or the State.
In the result the applicants have made out a satisfactory case for the
relief they seek, although not on the wide terms set out in the notice of
motion.  The relief will be confined to the terms set out in the order to be
made.
It must be emphasised that success in the application does not
guarantee the applicants’ acquittal in due course.  The final outcome of
the trial will ultimately depend upon the trial court’s impression of the

witnesses who testify and its overall assessment of the relevant facts and
probabilities.  The evidence sought to be led may not, in the end result,
after being subjected to testing and careful scrutiny, prevail against other,
more acceptable or persuasive evidence.
The following order is made:
1)
The convictions and sentences of the applicants (appellants) on all
counts are set aside;
2)
The matter is remitted to the trial court
(i)
to allow the applicants to call or re-call some or all of the
following witnesses for the purposes of examination or
further cross-examination, as the case may be, and to hear
their evidence or further evidence to the extent that such
evidence is relevant and admissible:

(a)

(ii)
to allow, in the exercise of its discretion, either the
applicants or the respondent to call any further witnesses
whose evidence it (the trial court) considers to be relevant
and material to a just determination of the issues between
the applicants and the respondent, and;
(iii)
to consider the further evidence led, hear argument thereon
and give a decision de novo on all the evidence.

3)
We express the hope that, in the interests of the proper
administration of justice, the further proceedings will commence as
a matter of urgency and be disposed of as expeditiously as
possible.

SOUTH AFRICA

In the matter between:

THE SPEAKER OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

APPELLANT

and

PATRICIA DE LILLE MP

FIRST RESPONDENT

THE PAN AFRICANIST CONGRESS OF AZANIA        SECOND RESPONDENT

COURT:
MAHOMED CJ, VAN HEERDEN DCJ, NIENABER, OLIVIER JJA, and
FARLAM AJA

DATE OF HEARING:
24-25 MAY 1999

DATE OF DELIVERY: 26 AUGUST 1999

SUMMARY:
A Member of Parliament (MP) made a number of unsubstantiated
allegations against other named members in the National Assembly.
On being reprimanded by the Speaker, she unconditionally
withdrew her remarks.  Despite this, the Assembly sought to punish
her by excluding her from its deliberations for 15 days.  The
Constitution does not grant the Assembly authority to suspend the
MP in these circumstances for that period.

JUDGMENT

. . . MAHOMED CJ
MAHOMED CJ

The first respondent (Arespondent@) in this appeal is a member of the National Assembly
(Athe Assembly@).  During an interpellation debate in the Assembly on 22 October 1997, the
respondent stated that the second respondent had information pertaining to twelve members of
the Aother side of the House@ (the ANC) who had been accused of having been Aspies for the
apartheid regime@.  She said it was necessary to know whether these accusations were true.  She
called on the Government to Atell the public at large who the agents are who received blood
money to betray the genuine struggle of the African people@.  She said it was no longer the
prerogative of the President to withhold information about who betrayed the soul of the nation.
These remarks provoked various interventions and the respondent was challenged to give the
names of those who were alleged to be Aspies@.  She eventually reacted to this challenge by
mentioning the names of eight persons including some who were not members of the Assembly.

The Speaker of the Assembly, who is the appellant, ruled that it was unparliamentary for
the respondent to use the word Aspies@ in referring to members of the Assembly and in doing so
to name such members of the Assembly.  The respondent was asked to withdraw this part of her
statement in the Assembly.

The respondent initially agreed to withdraw her remarks conditionally, because she
wanted an opportunity to consult the relevant rules of the Assembly.  The appellant insisted that
the respondent had to decide whether she was withdrawing the offending remarks or not.  She
was not entitled to a conditional withdrawal.  The respondent thereupon withdrew her statement
and was thanked by the appellant.

The matter was again raised on 27 October 1997 by the appellant who had in the
meanwhile examined the unrevised Hansard of the interpellation debate on 22 October.  She
referred to those parts of the statement previously made by the respondent which referred to
Aagents . . . who received blood money to betray the genuine struggle of the African people@ and
to Apeople who betrayed the soul of the nation@.  The respondent was asked also to withdraw
these parts because they were unsubstantiated allegations against members which reflected on
their integrity.  The respondent unconditionally withdrew the offending remarks.

The appellant thereupon said that the AHouse has accepted the practice that  members
should not be attacked by name in the House without prior notification.@  She added that she
wanted Ato encourage members to follow this practice in future.@

Later on 27 October 1997 a member of the ANC in the House proposed a motion to
appoint an Aad hoc committee to report to the House . . . on the conduct of Mrs P de Lille, in
making serious allegations without substantiation against members of the House on 22 October
1997, and to recommend what, if any, action the House should take in the light of its report.@
The motion was adopted by the Assembly by a majority of votes.  Only members of the
ANC supported the motion.

The ad hoc committee authorised by this resolution was duly appointed.  It consisted of
eight members of the ANC and seven members from the opposition.  It was at all times chaired
by a member of the ANC.  It convened on 5 November 1997 and continued its sittings on 6 and
25 November 1997.

The ad hoc committee adopted a report to the Assembly which included recommending
that the respondent:
a.
Be directed to apologize to the Assembly by means of a letter addressed to the
appellant;
b.
Be suspended for fifteen parliamentary working days with effect from the next
sitting day.

In substance these recommendations were adopted by the Assembly on 25 November
1997.  In addition it resolved that the apology which the respondent was directed to make
extended also to the individual members of the Assembly she had previously named in the
interpellation debate.  In a letter dated 15 December 1997 the Secretary of the Assembly wrote to
the respondent formally informing her of these decisions and stating that the Aperiod of
suspension would . . .  run from 2 to 20 February 1998.@

The respondent was aggrieved by these decisions and launched a formal application in
the Cape High Court impugning the relevant resolutions of the ad hoc committee and the
Assembly which led to her suspension, on the grounds that the majority of the members of the ad
hoc committee and the Assembly were biased against her, that they were mala fide and that she
did not receive a fair hearing before the impugned resolutions were adopted.

A full bench of the Cape High Court consisting of King DJP and Hlope J upheld this
attack and granted an order declaring void the relevant resolutions of the Assembly on 25
November 1997 impacting on the respondent.1

De Lille and another v Speaker of the National Assembly 1998 (3) SA 430 (C).

Mr Gauntlett SC who appeared for the appellant (together with Mr Heunis SC and Mr
Ngalwana) submitted that the evidence on affidavit which was relied on by the court a quo, did
not justify the conclusion that the majority of the ad hoc committee or the Assembly were biased
against the respondent or that they were mala fide or that they failed to accord to the respondent
a fair hearing before supporting the impugned resolutions.  This is strenuously disputed by Mr
Trengove SC who appeared for the respondent (with Mr Chaskalson and Mr Tredoux).  In the
view I take of this appeal, I shall assume without deciding that Mr Gauntlett is correct in his
submission.

That assumption is not sufficient, however, to resolve the appeal in favour of the
appellant.  Even if the impugned resolutions were adopted bona fide and even if the respondent
did receive a fair hearing preceding such adoption, the essential enquiry  which needs to be made
is whether or not in the circumstances disclosed by the record  the Assembly had any lawful
authority to take any steps to suspend the respondent from Parliament.

This enquiry must crucially rest on the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.  It is
Supreme - not Parliament.  It is the ultimate source of all lawful authority in the country.  No
Parliament, however bona fide or eminent its membership, no President, however formidable be
his reputation or scholarship and no official, however efficient or well meaning, can make any
law or perform any act which is not sanctioned by the Constitution.  Section 2 of the Constitution
expressly provides that law or conduct inconsistent with the Constitution is invalid and the
obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled.  It follows that any citizen adversely affected by any

decree, order or action of any official or body, which is not properly authorised by the
Constitution is entitled to the protection of the Courts.  No Parliament, no official and no
institution is immune from Judicial scrutiny in such circumstances.2

Executive Council, Western Cape Legislative v President of the RSA 1995 (4) SA 877 (CC). at
para=s 61-62, Ex parte Speaker of the National Assembly: In re Dispute Concerning the
Constitutionality of Certain Provisions of the National Education Policy Bill 83 of 1995 1996
(3) SA 289 (CC)  (1996 (4) BCLR 518) at para 22.

It is therefore necessary to examine the provisions of the Constitution to determine
whether there is any Constitutional authority which entitled the Assembly to suspend the
respondent in the circumstances relied on by the appellant.

The first section of the Constitution upon which reliance is placed on behalf of the
appellant is section 57.3  This section provides that the National Assembly Amay determine and
control its internal arrangements, proceedings and procedures@.  There can be no doubt that this

Section 57 reads as follows:
A(1)  The National Assembly may -
(a) determine and control its internal arrangements, proceedings and  procedures;
and
(b) make rules and orders concerning its business, with due regard to  representative
and participatory democracy, accountability, transparency  and public
involvement.
(2)  The rules and orders of the National Assembly must provide for -
(a) the establishment, composition, powers, functions, procedures and  duration of its
committees;
(b) the participation in the proceedings of the Assembly and its committees of all
minority political parties represented in the Assembly, in a manner  consistent
with democracy;
(c) financial and administrative assistance to each party represented in the Assembly
in proportion to its representation, to enable the party and its leader to perform
their functions in the Assembly effectively;  and
(d) the recognition of the leader of the largest opposition party in the Assembly as
the Leader of the Opposition.@

authority is wide enough to enable the Assembly to maintain internal order and discipline in its
proceedings by means which it considers appropriate for this purpose.  This would, for example,
include the power to exclude from the Assembly for temporary periods any member who is
disrupting or obstructing its proceedings or impairing unreasonably its ability to conduct its
business in an orderly or regular manner acceptable in a democratic society.4  Without some such
internal mechanism of control and discipline, the Assembly would be impotent to maintain
effective discipline and order during debates.

For this reason the Standing Rules for the Assembly give powers to the Speaker to suspend a
member of the Assembly in such circumstances for a maximum period of five Parliamentary
working days on the first occasion (See Rules 85 - 88 of the Standing Rules).  No such power
is given to the Assembly in terms of the relevant rules.

But it does not follow from this that the Assembly necessarily had the Constitutional
authority to suspend the respondent from its proceedings in the circumstances which it resolved
to do.  It is clear that the respondent was not suspended because her behaviour was obstructing or
disrupting or unreasonably impeding the management of orderly business within the Assembly,
but as some kind of punishment for making a speech in the Assembly some days earlier which
did not obstruct or disrupt the proceedings in the Assembly at the time, but was nevertheless
considered objectionable and unjustified by others including the majority of members of the ad
hoc committee and the Assembly.  As was explained by the Privy Council in Kielley v Carson5
the former kind of suspension is a necessary protective measure, the latter not.  The question
therefore that needs to be determined is not whether the Assembly or the appellant had lawful
authority to suspend the respondent from the Assembly as an orderly measure to protect
proceedings of the Assembly from obstruction or disruption, but whether or not it had the
authority to do so as a punishment or disciplinary measure for making a speech which was not in
any way obstructive or disruptive of proceedings in the Assembly, but which was nevertheless
open to justifiable objection.  That question cannot properly be answered by interpreting the
ambit of section 57(1)(a) of the Constitution in isolation, but  by reading it together with other
relevant provisions including section 58.6

[1842] 13 ER 225 (PC).

The full text of section 58(1) and (2) reads as follows:
A(1)
Cabinet members and members of the National Assembly -
(a) have freedom of speech in the Assembly and in its committees, subject  to its
rules and orders; and
(b)
are not liable to civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or
damages for -
(i) anything that they have said in, produced before or submitted to the
Assembly or any of its committees; or
(ii) anything revealed as a result of anything that they have said in,
produced before or submitted to the Assembly or any of its  committees.
(2) Other privileges and immunities of the National Assembly, Cabinet members  and
members of the Assembly may be prescribed by national legislation.@

Section 58(1)(a) provides that Cabinet members and members of the National Assembly
have freedom of speech in the Assembly and its committees, subject to its rules and orders.
Section 58(1)(b)(i) goes on to provide that such members are not liable to civil or criminal
proceedings, arrest or imprisonment or damages Afor anything they have said in, produced before
or submitted to the Assembly or any of its committees@.  Section 58(2) states that A[o]ther
privileges and immunities of the National Assembly . . . may be prescribed by national
legislation.@

The main argument of Mr Gauntlett on behalf of the appellant was based on section
58(2).  He contended that if section 57(1)(a) is read with section 58(2) it ultimately provides
constitutional authority for the suspension of the respondent in the circumstances I have referred
to.  This submission is based on a series of interrelated, complex and sometimes even perplexing
propositions.  The first proposition is that section 36 of the Powers and Privileges of Parliament
Act No 91 of 1963 (Athe PPP Act@) (which preserves in general terms the Aprivileges, immunities
and powers@ which Parliament enjoyed at the date of the enactment of Act 32 of 1961)7
constitutes Anational legislation@ which Aprescribes other privileges and immunities of the
National Assembly@ within the meaning of section 58(2) of the Constitution.  The second
proposition is that the effect of section 36 of the PPP Act in so preserving the Aprivileges,

Section 36 of the PPP Act provides as follows:
ASave as is otherwise expressly provided by this Act, Parliament, a member and an officer of
Parliament, respectively, shall have all such privileges, immunities and powers as at the time
of the promulgation of the Constitution were applicable in the case of the House of Assembly
referred to in the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961 (Act 32 of 1961), and any
member or officer thereof and also such privileges, immunities and powers as are from time to
time conferred by any law of the Republic.@

immunities and powers@ which Parliament enjoyed at the date of the enactment of 1961, was also
to preserve the provisions of section 36 of Act 19 of 1911 which provided inter alia that save as
otherwise expressed in that Act, the members of the House of Assembly would enjoy the same
privileges enjoyed by the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom or the
members thereof.  The third proposition is that one of the privileges or powers, which the House
of Commons in the United Kingdom enjoys (although rarely exercised) is the power to suspend a
member of the House for contempt and other breaches of privilege.  This power, it is argued, is
part of the law and custom of Parliament in the United Kingdom.8  The fourth proposition is that
the end result of the previous three propositions is to render lawful the respondent=s suspension,
because it would be lawful in terms of the parliamentary law and custom of the United Kingdom
which is incorporated through an interpretation of a successive web of South African legislation
over a period of more than eighty years.

Halsbury=s Laws of England (4th ed Vol 34 para 1009); O Hood Phillips: Constitutional and
Administrative Law (7th Edition p 131); Coke: Fourth Institutes of the Laws of England (1797)
p 50.
Central to the edifice which the appellant seeks to erect on the strength of these
propositions in defence of the respondent=s suspension is one basic premise.  It is this: By

incorporating a reference to other laws which in turn incorporate further laws which incorporate
the Parliamentary law and custom of the United Kingdom which arguably allows for the
suspension of members of Parliament, section 36 of the PPP Act is Aprescribing@ Aother
privileges and immunities of the National Assembly@ and its members within the meaning of
these expressions in section 58(2) of the Constitution.  In my view this basic premise is unsound
in law.  Section 58(1) expressly guarantees freedom of speech in the Assembly (subject to its
rules and orders).  It is a crucial guarantee. The threat that a member of the Assembly may be
suspended for something said in the assembly inhibits freedom of expression in the Assembly
and must therefore adversely impact on that guarantee.  Section 58(2) must not be interpreted in
the manner contended by Mr Gauntlett so as to detract from that guarantee.  What section 58(2)
does is to authorise national legislation which will itself clearly and specifically articulate the
Aprivileges and the immunities@ of the National Assembly which have the effect of impacting on
the specific guarantee of free speech for members in the Assembly.  It does not contemplate a
tortuous process of discovery of some obscure rule in English Parliamentary law and custom
justifying the suspension of a member of Parliament which is not identified within section 36
itself, but is to be inferred from a South African statute in 1911 which is inferentially
incorporated in another statute in 1961 which is itself incorporated by reference in section 36 of
the PPP Act.  Section 36, in my view, therefore, does not constitute Anational legislation@ which
Aprescribes@ any Aprivileges and immunities@ of the National Assembly (within the meaning of
section 58(2) of the Constitution), which justifies the invasion of the guarantee of free speech in
section 58(1) through the mechanism of the punitive suspension of a member of the Assembly.

Mr Gauntlett relied heavily on the case of Poovalingam v Rajbansi9 in support of his

1992 (1) SA 283 (A).

interpretation of section 58(2).  He drew our attention to the review of Parliamentary privilege in
South Africa contained in the judgment of Corbett CJ10 in that matter.  In my view
Poovalingam=s case does not assist the argument of Mr Gauntlett in the present appeal.  The
dispute in Poovalingam=s case was whether a certain letter delivered by one member of a
Parliament to other members and which was said to be defamatory of a particular member
was protected by the guarantee of free speech in Parliament contained in sections 2 and 8
of the PPP Act.  Corbett CJ held that it was not.  In the course of doing so he analysed the
history of the privilege conferred on members of Parliament, through its origins in
English law and concluded that there was a Aclose bond between our law and English law
on the subject of Parliamentary privilege.@11  The Court was not confronted with or
required to deal with the issue as to whether or not an express Constitutional guarantee of
free speech for members of a Parliamentary Assembly such as that protected by section
58(1) of the present Constitution could be restricted through Aother privileges and
immunities@ inherited from English Parliamentary custom in a general way without being
specifically prescribed by national legislation of the nature contemplated by section 58(2).

Moreover, the constitutional regime which operated when Poovalingam=s case was
decided was the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act 110 of 1983 which had no provisions
corresponding with important provisions of the present (1996) Constitution  relevant to the
present debate.  Not only is the right to freedom of speech in the Assembly expressly

Especially at pp 290-91.
At 291F-G.

constitutionalised in section 58(1)(a) (subject to its rules and orders), but the Arules and orders@
which the Assembly makes to control its Ainternal arrangements, proceedings and procedures,@
must, in terms of section 57(1)(b), have Adue regard to representative and participatory
democracy.@  These provisions are also materially different from the comparable provisions of
the interim Constitution contained in Act 200 of 1993.12

Properly interpreted, the provisions of section 58(2) of the Constitution therefore do not
support the approach contended for by Mr Gauntlett.  Section 58(2) does not itself Aprescribe@
any other Aprivilege or immunity@, to limit the right of free speech in the Assembly protected by
section 58(1).  National legislation is necessary to achieve that result.

See sections 55 and 58 of Act 200 of 1993.

The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant based on section 58(2) of the
Constitution and Section 36 of the PPP Act is countered by Mr Trengove by another suggested
obstruction.  It is this: Section 36 of the PPP Act is preceded by the phrase A[s]ave as is otherwise
expressly provided by this Act@.  This means that the Aprivileges, immunities and powers@ of the
National Assembly at the time of the promulgation of Act 32 of 1961 which the section seeks to
preserve, only apply to the extent to which the PPP Act does not provide otherwise.

It is contended that Section 10 of the PPP Act, does however, provide very elaborate
mechanisms to discipline and punish members of the Assembly.  Section 10(3) refers to 13
different forms of contempt which Parliament can punish.  They include the kind of contempt
which the respondent in this matter is said to have committed.  Section 10 also provides for
punishment in the form of a fine and detention where such fine has not been paid.  Mr Trengove
argued that in effect the PPP Act codifies what the different forms of contempt are and how they
are to be punished.  No provision is made, however, for suspension as a form of punishment for a
member who is guilty of contempt of the kind attributed to the respondent.13

Section 10(1) of the PPP Act read with section 10(2) and section 32.

Mr Gauntlett, contended, however, that section 10 is not exhaustive.  He argued
that it is not inconsistent with the retention of the power of suspension in appropriate
cases, if this is permitted by the legislation incorporating English Parliamentary law and
custom in the manner I have previously described.  Mr Trengove argued that  the detailed
structure of the PPP Act, does not permit of such an interpretation but even if it did, the
Act is also at least reasonably capable of the interpretation that it is indeed exhaustive in
respect of the punishments which are competent for contempt.  It was contended that in
that event the latter construction must be preferred because it would be more consistent
with the spirit and purpose of the Constitution and its anxiety to protect freedom of
speech and more particularly the right of members representing voters, to express
themselves freely and without fear on matters of public interest.  It was pointed out that
section 39(2) of the Constitution expressly directs that Awhen interpreting any legislation .
. . every court, tribunal or forum must promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of
Rights.@14

Although the alternative submissions of Mr Trengove referred to in paragraphs 24,

See Du Plessis and Others v De Klerk and Another 1996 (3) SA 850 (CC) (1996 (5) BCLR
658) at paras 60-66, 86, 141; Holomisa v Argus Newspapers Ltd 1996 (2) SA 588 (W) at
596C-598E; Director: Mineral Development Gauteng Region and another v Save the Vaal
Environment and others unreported decision of the SCA, 133/98 (12 March 1999).

25, and 26 are certainly arguable, I find it unnecessary to decide on the correctness
thereof, because of the conclusions I have come to in respect of his other submissions
dealt with in this judgment.

If section 58(2)  provides no constitutional authority for the suspension of the respondent
from the National Assembly, is there any other provision in the Constitution which does?  In the
alternative to his main argument, Mr Gauntlett contended that such authority is to be inferred
from section 58(1)(a) which limits the right to freedom of speech in the Assembly by making it
subject to its rules and orders.  It was conceded that the rules and orders of the Assembly do not
themselves make any provision for the suspension of the members by the Assembly, but it was
contended that this effect is achieved through Rule 77(A)(1) of the Standing Rules of the
Assembly which makes freedom of speech and debate in the House itself Asubject to the
restriction placed on such freedom in terms of the Constitution, any other law or these Rules.@15
It is argued again that this incorporates section 36 of the PPP Act, which through a series of
subsequent incorporations of other laws, ultimately incorporates English Parliamentary law and
custom, which in certain instances allows the House of Commons to suspend its members.  The
reasons which I have set out in rejecting a similar argument in dealing with the submission that
section 58(2) provides constitutional authority for the suspension of the respondent, are of equal

Rule 77(A)(1) of the current Standing Rules of the Assembly provides that:
AIn accordance with section 55(2) of the [interim] Constitution [now section 58(1) of the
Constitution] there shall be freedom of speech and debate in or before this House and any
committee thereof, or any joint committee of Parliament, subject only to the restrictions placed
on such freedom in terms of or under the Constitution, any other law or these Rules.@

application to the appellant=s case in this respect based on section 58(1).

There is therefore nothing in the Arules and orders@ of the Assembly, which qualifies in
any respect relevant to the appeal, the right to freedom of speech in the Assembly which section
58(1) guarantees.  More directly, there is nothing which provides any constitutional authority for
the Assembly, to punish any member of the Assembly, for making any speech, through an order
suspending such member from the proceedings of the Assembly.  The right of free speech in the
Assembly protected by section 58(1) is a fundamental right crucial to representative government
in a democratic society.  Its tenor and spirit must conform to all other provisions of the
Constitution relevant to the conduct  of proceedings in Parliament.

In the result, the appellant has failed to persuade me that the National Assembly had any
constitutional authority to suspend the respondent from the National Assembly in the
circumstances disclosed by the evidence adduced before the High Court.

The respondent would therefore be entitled to an order declaring her purported
suspension to be void, unless there is some legal basis for excluding the jurisdiction of the Court
to afford such relief to her.

In the context under consideration there was considerable debate by counsel in the heads
of argument, with regard to the implications and the correctness of various dicta in the Canadian
case of New Brunswick Broadcasting Co v Nova Scotia.16  The issue in that case was whether the
exclusion of media representatives from proceedings in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly

(1993) 13 CRR (2nd) 1 (SC).

because they were seeking to televise the proceedings violated the right to freedom of expression
articulated in section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter.  McLachlin J held in that case that the
Legislative Assembly concerned had an inherent constitutional right to exclude strangers from its
chambers in order to protect itself against the disruptions of its business.  Our attention was
drawn to the following dicta by the learned Judge:17

AHaving concluded that the Assembly had the Constitutional right to do what it did, it
follows that the Charter cannot cut down that right, on the principle that one part of the
Constitution cannot abrogate another part of the Constitution.@

At 21.

The approach of McLachlin J in this case was not fully shared by the other Judges18 and is
the subject of considerable controversy in Canada.19  It is, however, unnecessary in the
present appeal to pursue this controversy.  Nothing in any of the judgments in the case of
New Brunswick Broadcasting Co v Nova Scotia supports the proposition that a purported
exercise of power, not properly authorised by the Constitution, is immune from judicial
scrutiny and convention.  The issue in that case was whether the exercise of such a power
violated the Canadian Charter of fundamental rights, and if it did so, whether it was
subject to ACharter review@.  Those questions might or might not have risen in the present
appeal if it was necessary to decide that the appellant or the National Assembly had
violated the Bill of Rights in Chapter 2 of the Constitution, by failing to afford to the
respondent a fair bona fide hearing.  I have found it unnecessary to decide that issue.  The
only relevant issue is whether or not the suspension of the respondent by the National
Assembly was constitutionally authorised.  I have held that it was not.

The appellant also adduced a certificate in terms of section 5 of the PPP Act20 in the court
a quo ostensibly as some kind of obstacle to the jurisdiction of the Court to afford to the
respondent the relief she sought.  Counsel for the appellant, before us, however expressly

Cory J at p 58; Lamer CJ at p 42.
See Peter W Hogg: Constitutional Law of Canada, loose-leaf edition Vol. 2 pp 34-9 to 34-10.
Section 5 provides as follows:
AAt any stage of any civil or criminal proceedings instituted for or on account or in respect
of any matter of privilege, upon production to the court or judge by the defendant or
accused, of a certificate by the Speaker or, in his absence or other incapacity, by the
Secretary, stating that the matter in question is one which concerns the privilege of
Parliament, that court or judge shall immediately stay such proceedings, which shall
thereupon be deemed to be finally determined.@

abandoned any reliance on this certificate.

The court a quo was therefore correct in holding that the decision of the National
Assembly on 25 November 1997 to suspend the respondent was void.  The order made by the
Court however to uphold prayers 2.1, 2.3 and 2.5 of the notice of motion needs re-examination.
Prayer 2.1 sought to declare void the whole of the resolution passed by the National Assembly on
25 November 1997.  That resolution included two parts: the first part directed the respondent to
apologise, and the second part resolved to suspend her from Parliament.  The attack of the
respondent was confined to the second part.  The period of suspension has in any event expired.
Counsel were agreed that if the submissions on behalf of the appellant made by Mr Gauntlett
failed, the proper course would be to make an order declaring that the National Assembly was
not entitled in law to make an order purporting to suspend the respondent from the National
Assembly.

Costs

Notwithstanding the fact that the whole of the order of the court a quo cannot be
sustained on appeal, the respondent has achieved substantial success on appeal.  There is no
reason why the appellant should ordinarily  not be directed to pay the costs of the respondent.
The respondent engaged three counsel on appeal.  They were Mr Trengove,  Mr Chaskalson and
Mr Tredoux.  Mr Trengove and Mr Chaskalson, however, appeared pro-amico.  Mr Trengove for
the respondent, therefore asked for an order dismissing the appeal, and an order of costs
consequent upon the employment of Mr Tredoux and in respect of only the disbursements of Mr
Trengove and Mr Chaskalson.

Order

It is ordered that:
(1)
The order made by the court a quo is set aside, subject to paragraph 2.
(2)
The order of costs made by the court a quo is upheld.
(3)
It is declared that that part of the resolution of the National Assembly adopted on
the 25 November 1997 which purports to suspend Mrs Patricia De Lille is void
and is set aside.
(4)
The appellant is directed to pay the costs of the respondent on appeal.  Such costs
shall include:
(a)
The costs attendant upon the employment of Mr Tredoux;
(b)
Only the disbursements incurred by or on behalf of Mr Trengove and Mr
Chaskalson, (including the reasonable costs of accommodation and
travel).

_________________________________________________________

JUDGMENT
_________________________________________________________

. . . SMALBERGER JA
SMALBERGER JA:

[1] The Islamic Propagation Centre International (Athe Trust@) was
formed by a Notarial Deed of Trust (Athe Trust Deed@) in April 1985 and
duly registered with the Master of the Supreme Court (Athe Master@) on
19 June 1985.  The third respondent was a co-founder and one of the
original trustees of the Trust, a position he has continued to occupy since.
The Trust Deed initially provided for five trustees; in August 1986 the
number was increased to seven.  The Trust owns very substantial assets
including four valuable income - producing properties.
[2] Regrettably the affairs of the Trust have not always run smoothly.
Factionalism within the ranks of the trustees has led to deteriorating
relationships between them.  This has inevitably been prejudicial to the
proper management of the Trust.  It has resulted in deadlock and frequent
litigation between individual trustees or groups of trustees.

[3] On 4 May 1996 the third respondent unfortunately suffered a
stroke leaving him paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak.
For present purposes it may be accepted that notwithstanding his
physical disability he remains of sound mind and is able to communicate
in a fashion through a computer aided communication system.  However,
his disability precludes him from attending meetings of the trustees and
performing his related duties as a trustee.  This effectively led to a shift
in the balance of power within the ranks of the feuding trustees.  To
remedy this the third respondent, on 10 March 1997, granted a Special
Power of Attorney (Athe Power of Attorney@) to his daughter-in-law, the
first respondent, to represent him at meetings of the Trust.
[4] This gave rise to an application in the Durban and Coast Local
Division by the appellants (as applicants) to have, inter alia, the Power

of Attorney Adeclared to be null and void and of no legal force and
effect@ and to interdict the first respondent from acting Aas a trustee of the
[Trust] as the agent of . . . . the third respondent.@
[5] When the application was launched the trustees of the Trust were
the three appellants and the second, third and fourth respondents.  The
position of the seventh trustee was vacant.  The appointment of the third
appellant as trustee has since been set aside (see Deedat and Another v
The Master and Others 1998(1) SA 544 (N)).  An application by the
Master for the removal of the remaining trustees is currently being heard
in the Durban and Coast Local Division.
[6] The history of the course taken by the application appears from the
judgment of the court a quo (Magid J) which is reported as Hoosen NO
and Others v Deedat and Others [1997] 3 ALL SA 32 (D) and need not

be repeated.
[7] The issue which ultimately fell to be decided was whether the third
respondent was entitled in law to delegate his duties qua trustee in terms
of the Power of Attorney.  The learned judge found for the respondents,
holding that the Power of Attorney did not constitute an invalid
delegation of the third respondent=s functions.  He further awarded costs
against the appellants de bonis propriis.  He subsequently granted leave
to appeal to this Court.  The issue referred to is the sole issue on appeal.
[8] In terms of the Power of Attorney the third respondent purported
to appoint the first respondent
Ato act on my behalf and in my name and place for the
express purposes of voting on my behalf in all meetings of
the
ISLAMIC
PROPAGATION
CENTRE
INTERNATIONAL TRUST as the said YASMIN
DEEDAT may deem fit so long as it does not militate
against the aims, objects and conditions as contained in the

Constitution of the ISLAMIC PROPAGATION CENTRE
INTERNATIONAL TRUST, that I am a founder member
of.@

[9] The Power of Attorney proceeds:

AMRS YASMIN DEEDAT is also empowered to sign all
documents on my behalf and to do all the necessary and to
give effect to any decision that may be taken by the
Trustees of the ISLAMIC PROPAGATION CENTRE
INTERNATIONAL and generally to do all such things to
give effect to the aforesaid wherever and whenever
necessary.

And generally for effecting the purposes aforesaid, to do or
cause to be done, whatsoever shall be requisite, as fully and
effectually, to all intents and purposes, as I might or could
do if personally present and acting therein; hereby ratifying,
allowing and confirming, and promising and agreeing to
ratify, allow and confirm all and whatsoever my said Agent
shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of these
presents.@

[10] The provisions of the power of Attorney must be interpreted
objectively in order to determine their precise ambit and legal effect.  It

is legally irrelevant that the third respondent may not have contemplated
the first respondent exercising an independent discretion, and may have
intended no more than that she be a mere conduit for his wishes.
[11] The Power of Attorney empowers the first respondent to vote at
meetings of the Trust as she Amay deem fit@.  On a proper construction,
this entitles her to exercise an independent judgment and form her own
view in relation to matters arising at the meetings.  She is not legally
obliged to ascertain the wishes of the third respondent or to give effect to
his directions, whatever she may consider her moral obligation to be in
that regard.  Where voting at a meeting calls for the exercise of a
discretion it falls to her to exercise such discretion, thereby supplanting
the function of the third respondent in that respect.  This renders her
position akin to that of a duly elected trustee, which she is not.

[12] Moreover, any decision to which the first respondent may come, as
reflected in the way she votes, would not be subject to control or
correction by the third respondent, even though he may have to assume
responsibility for it.  This is because he has, in terms of the Power of
Attorney, ratified her actions in advance, or at least bound himself to
ratify them.  While he could revoke the Power of Attorney, he could not
undo what had already been done.
[13] The qualification in the Power of Attorney that the first respondent
may vote as she deems fit Aso long as it does not militate against the
aims, objects and conditions as contained in the Constitution of the
[Trust]@ is mere surplusage and takes the matter no further.  It places no
limitation on her voting powers as compared to those of the third
respondent.  It merely makes her subject to the same constraints that

applied to him.  It does not detract from the fact that she may, when
voting, operate as effectively and independently as any duly and properly
appointed trustee.
[14] To sum up, the Power of Attorney, properly construed, seeks to
transfer to the first respondent the third respondent=s rights and duties,
and concomitant powers, arising from attendance and voting at meetings
of the Trust.  This amounts to a delegation to the first respondent of the
third respondent=s judgment and discretion in relation to the decision
making process of the Trust.  It constitutes at least a temporary
abdication of the third respondent=s functions in favour of a non-trustee.
The question arises whether that is a legally permissible delegation.   [15]

The Trust, as the name implies, is a religious trust established to
further the aims of Islam.  Clause 2 of the Trust provides that the objects

of the Trust shall be
A2.1. to create a fund primarily to promote charitable and
religious activities of the Islamic Faith;

2.2.
To propagate the Islamic faith to Muslims and non-
Muslims primarily through the offices of the  [Trust]
. . .@

The latter object is to be achieved (in terms of clause 2.2.1 - 8) by means,
inter alia, of public lectures, the distribution of the Holy Quran and
various other ways of promoting Islam.  The use of the word Aprimarily@
in clause 2.2 indicates that the propagation of the faith of Islam may go
beyond the matters listed in clause 2.2.1 - 8.  Any such extension would
call for consideration by the trustees and the exercise of the necessary
judgment and discretion on their part.
[16] Clause 3 deals with the powers of the trustees in relation to the
general administration of the Trust.  These include

A3.4 To manage and control the Trust or other
institutions established or acquired by the
Trust and to appoint, and at their discretion
remove, or suspend managers, secretaries,
clerks, agents and servants for permanent,
temporary or special services, as they from
time to time think fit, and to invest them with
such powers (including power to sub-delegate)
as they may think expedient . . .
and

3.6
Generally to do all such other things and carry
out all such undertakings as may be expedient
to further the interest of the Trust or which
may be incidental or conducive to the
attainment of the aforesaid objects.@

[17] Clause 4 provides that

AAll the business and affairs of the Trust shall be managed
and controlled by the Trustees, who shall have full power to
carry out the objects of the Trust as hereinbefore provided .
. . .@

[18] In terms of clause 5 (as amended) the Board of Trustees shall

consist of not more than seven (previously five) Muslim members, all of
whom shall hold office for life.  The first five trustees were the co-
founders of the Trust.  The relevant portion (for present purposes) of
clause 7 reads:
AOn the death, resignation or removal from office of any of
the Trustees and as often as a vacancy shall occur, the
remaining Trustees shall as soon as conveniently possible
elect another Trustee, a two-thirds majority decision shall
be considered sufficient for such election . . .@

[19] Clause 9 provides that any major decision of the Trust has to be
ratified by at least two-thirds of the Trustees then holding office; clause
10 exempts the Trustees from the filing of any security with the Master;
clause 15 makes provision for the annual balance sheet to be signed by
the auditor Aand by such of the Trustees as shall be delegated to that end
from time to time.@

[20] Further relevant provisions are to be found in clauses 21 and 22.
They provide:
A21. The Trust shall be a body of perpetual succession
and the Trustees or their successors shall neither
have the right nor the power to terminate the Trust
. . . .

22.
Any matter [for] which no provision has been included in this
Deed of Trust shall be decided upon by the Trustees and such
decision shall be binding and effective as if it were a clause in
this Deed of Trust.@
[21] A trustee in the narrow or strict sense (the kind with which we are dealing) is
not an agent.  (As to the main points of distinction between them see Honore=s South
African Law of Trusts: 4th Ed, pp 57/8.)  He, unlike an agent, does not derive his
powers from a principal to whom he is responsible.  As he does not exercise
derivative powers the maxim delegatus delegare non potest, initially relied upon by
the appellants= counsel, cannot assist the appellants.
[22] As the authority of the trustees derives from the terms of the Trust Deed its
provisions have to be considered in order to determine whether it expressly or

impliedly authorises delegation by an individual trustee of his powers and functions.

[23] It is apparent from a consideration of the Trust Deed that no express provision
is made for the delegation by any individual trustee of any of his rights, duties or
powers.  The Trust Deed only provides for collective action by the trustees.  Control
and management of the Trust vests in the trustees jointly (clauses 3 and 4).  Where
specific provision is made for the delegation of functions (see clauses 3.4 and 15),
such delegation is made by the trustees acting in concert (or at least a majority of
them).  The Trust Deed makes no provision for the exercise of any powers or
functions by individual trustees unless authorised thereto by the body of trustees.
This is in keeping with the general principle that where the administration of a trust is
vested in co-trustees they must execute their duties in their joint capacity.
[24] It is also noteworthy that where provision is made for delegation in the Trust
Deed, such delegation relates to matters that are by and large purely administrative.
The delegation does not relate to areas where the exercise of a discretion is called for
by the trustees in carrying out their duties of management and control.  This accords

with the principle that the fundamental decisions relating to a trust need to be taken
by the trustees; the implementation of such decisions may be delegated to others,
although ultimate responsibility remains with the trustees (cf Erlank=s Trustee v Allan
[1909] TS 303 at 306).
[25] In the absence of express authorisation in the Trust Deed permitting an
individual trustee to delegate his functions in the manner sought to be done by the
third respondent in terms of the Power of Attorney, is there scope for an implied
authorisation to that effect? In my view not.
[26] The essentially collective nature of the trustees= duties and the general
prohibition against the delegation of a fundamental discretionary power would
militate against any such implied authorisation.  Nor is a power to delegate necessary
for the proper exercise of an individual trustee=s rights and duties under the Trust.  In
considering the issue one may also, by analogy, draw usefully from an established
principle in the law of agency, while not losing sight of the essential differences
between a trustee and an agent.  That principle states that where the identity and
personal attributes or skills of the performer of an act are of material importance,

delegation is not permitted (Strydom v Roodewal Management Committee and
Another 1958 (1) SA 272 (O) at 273G; Pothier=s Treatise on the Contract of
Mandate:  par 99; Kerr: The Law of Agency: 3rd Ed, p 237).
[27] The Trust was established in the interests of the Muslim community in order
to propagate and promote the Islamic faith.  The trustees would have to be people
imbued with the spirit of Islam who could be relied upon to give effect to the objects
of the Trust.  Those objects are of such a nature as to require the exercise of personal
judgment and discretion in relation to policy decisions of one kind or another.  The
wide powers accorded the trustees point to the founders of the Trust reposing faith in
their values, judgment and discretion.  The personal attributes of the trustees would
inevitably have played a significant if not conclusive role in their selection.  Those
same attributes would also be of concern to, and have an influence on, potential
donors of the Trust.
[28] The importance of the personal attributes and skills of the trustees is
underscored by the fact that the co-founders of the Trust appointed themselves joint
trustees of the Trust for life.  The self-perpetuating nature of the Trust enables the

trustees, on the death or resignation of one of their members, to appoint to the
vacancy (also for life) someone with similar values (cultural and spiritual) as their
own and someone whose judgment and abilities are respected by them.  Thus the
person of the trustee assumes importance in the overall design and functioning of the
Trust; and a person elected as trustee must have the support of at least two thirds of
the remaining trustees.  I accordingly conclude, contrary to what was held by the
judge a quo, that the trustees are people selected for their personal attributes.
Applying the principle referred to in paragraph [26] above precludes, in my view,
any suggestion of implied authorisation.
[29] I am thus of the view that the delegation by the third respondent of his powers
and duties to the first respondent in terms of the Power of Attorney was legally
impermissible as it was neither expressly nor impliedly authorised by the Trust Deed.
I do not consider it necessary to deal with the reasoning of the judge a quo in
arriving at a different conclusion.
[30] It follows that the appellants were entitled to an order in the terms sought.
Originally what was sought was a rule nisi.  It is common cause that at this stage the

appellants, if successful, would be entitled to a final order.
[31] There remains the question of costs.  In their application the appellants sought
costs against the first and second respondents (in the case of the latter, de bonis
propriis).  In dismissing their application the court a quo granted costs against the
appellants de bonis propriis.  That order will now fall away, and what is to be
decided is the appropriate order as to costs both in the court below and on appeal.
[32] Significantly, no order for costs has ever been sought against the third
respondent, yet it is his conduct in giving the first respondent a power of attorney that
has led to the present litigation.  It is perfectly understandable that the third
respondent, as a founder of the Trust - and by all accounts the guiding spirit behind
the Trust - should, despite his manifest incapacity, wish to remain a trustee and
maintain an interest in the Trust=s affairs.  The reason why no costs= order was sought
from the third respondent may well have been that the validity of the course he took
was linked to a proper interpretation of the Trust Deed.
[33] A number of disputed factual issues arose on the papers.  These have
remained unresolved.  The real issue, both in the court below and on appeal,

concerned the legal validity of the Power of Attorney.  This in turn involved the
interpretation of the Trust Deed.
[34] The appellants were entitled to challenge the Power of Attorney and have
done so successfully.  There exists no sound basis for depriving them of their costs.
The question is, who is to pay them?
[35] I see no reason why first and second respondents should have distanced
themselves from the proceedings.  Second respondent was entitled initially to answer
the factual allegations made against him.  When the only remaining issue related to
the validity of the Power of Attorney, he was entitled to be heard as trustee insofar as
an interpretation of the Trust Deed was called for.  In addition he was entitled to
oppose the costs= order sought against him personally.
[36] The first respondent, as matters turned out, could have abided the decision of
the court (although she too had a costs= order sought against her).  But she obviously
(and understandably) feels a certain loyalty towards the third respondent, and her
appearances in person on appeal and in the court below could not materially have
contributed towards the costs.

[37] In all the circumstances I am of the view that as an interpretation of the Trust
Deed was reasonably called for it would be appropriate, in the proper exercise of our
discretion, to order that the costs of the proceedings both in this court and below be
borne by the Trust.  This must not be seen as a licence to the trustees to continue
feuding.  They should be warned that the costs of any future litigation between them,
in the light of what has occurred in the past, are likely to have to be borne by them
personally, and conceivably on a punitive scale.
The following order is made:
1)
The appeal succeeds.
2)
The order of the court a quo is set aside and there is substituted in its stead
the following:
A1.
The Special Power of Attorney purportedly executed by the
Third Respondent in favour of the First Respondent on 10
March 1997 is declared to be of no legal force and effect.
2.
The First Respondent is interdicted from acting in terms of
the aforesaid Special Power of Attorney.@
3)
The costs of all parties in respect of both the application in the court a quo
and on appeal to this court are to be borne by the Islamic Propagation Centre

International.

Constitutional law: Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Appeal in terms of Item 17 of Schedule 6
to Act 108 of 1996; Interim Constitution Act 200 of 1993 - whether common law grounds for
judicial review of administrative actions still exist. Customs and Excise: Commissioner’s decision
under s 99(2)(a)(iii) of Act 91 of 1964 - reasonable steps.

J U D G M E N T

Hefer JA

[1] The provisions of S101(5) of the interim Constitution, Act 200 of 1993, effectively precluded
the erstwhile Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa from adjudicating any
matter relating to the interpretation, protection and enforcement of the provisions of the interim
Constitution and even from determining the scope of its own jurisdiction whenever the
determination required constitutional interpretation.
[2] On 4 February 1997 the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996
superseded the interim Constitution. Under the new Constitution the Appellate Division became
the Supreme Court of Appeal which has full appellate jurisdiction in constitutional matters, subject
to a further appeal in such matters to the Constitutional Court, and is the highest court of appeal
in other matters.
[3] The present appeals, in which identical common law and constitutional issues have been
raised, were heard together and may conveniently be disposed of in a single judgment. Where it
becomes necessary to distinguish between the respondents I will refer to the respondent in
appeal No 196/96 as ""Conlog"" and to the other respondent as ""Renfreight"". The appeals were
noted during March 1996 (ie before the new Constitution took effect) and relate to two decisions
taken by the Commissioner for Customs and Excise during December 1994 which were set aside
in review proceedings in the Transvaal Provincial Division during October 1995.
[4] Pending cases are regulated by Item 17 of the Sixth Schedule to the new Constitution which
provides that
""[a]ll proceedings which were pending before a Court when the new Constitution took effect, must
be disposed of as if the new Constitution had not been enacted, unless the interests of justice
require otherwise.""
According to the judgment of this Court in Fedsure Life Assurance Ltd and Others v Greater
Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council and Others 1998(2) SA 1115 (SCA) at 1126A-C
the decision whether the interests of justice require an appeal to be disposed of is taken ad hoc
having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. But that case was referred to the
Constitutional Court and part of that Court’s order is to the effect that
""in respect of constitutional issues under the interim Constitution which may in future come before
the SCA, including matters within the purview of s 24 of the interim Constitution, it is in the
interests of justice for that Court to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by chap 8 of the
1966 Constitution.""
(See the judgment reported under the same name in 1999(1) SA 374(CC) at 415D-F.)
[5] I do not regard this part of the order as a binding direction, firstly, because that part of the
judgment to which it relates is entirely obiter and, secondly, because the order itself amounts to
no more than a statement of the Court's view of the interests of justice. I share those views, but
the underlying policy considerations did not deter the legislature from depriving the Appellate
Division of constitutional jurisdiction in the interim Constitution; and, as Mahomed CJ said,
referring to the new Constitution in Fedsure at 1126A-B,
""[i]f this is what the lawgiver had intended (ie that this Court should assume jurisdiction to
adjudicate upon all constitutional issues irrespective of whether they arose before or after the
commencement of the new Constitution) it could easily have said so. It deliberately refrained from
doing so. What it directed was that pending proceedings must be disposed of as if the new
Constitution had not been enacted unless, in the particular circumstances of a particular case, the
interests of justice required otherwise.""

This dictum appears in a unanimous judgment of this Court and we must follow it unless we are
convinced that it is plainly wrong. Far from being so convinced, I respectfully agree with it. What
accordingly has first to be decided is whether the interests of justice require the present appeals
to be disposed of.
[6] In urging us to do so, counsel on both sides mentioned the fact that the judgment of the Court
a quo was delivered more than four and a half years ago; that the hearing of the appeals was
delayed at the request of this Court pending the Constitutional Court's decision in the Fedsure
case; that huge amounts of money are at stake, and that the Commissioner and other interested
parties are awaiting the outcome in order to arrange their affairs in other matters. These are
weighty considerations; but what weighs with me even more, is the fact that the review
proceedings were brought on constitutional as well as common law grounds. That the
jurisdictional scheme under the interim Constitution was inexpedient and not apt became
particularly noticeable in appeals to the Appellate Division involving both common law and
constitutional issues. Rudolph and Another v Commissioner for Inland Revenue and Others was
a typical case. It was a relatively simple matter but, because it allegedly had a constitutional
dimension, the Appellate Division could only deal with it after a referral to the Constitutional Court.
(Three reported judgments in that case appear in 1996(2) SA 886 (A), 1996(4) SA 552 (CC) and
1997(4) SA 391 (SCA).) This might also be the fate of the present appeals if we were to refuse to
hear them at this stage. In my view the circumstances are such that the interests of justice
demand that we dispose of them.
[7] Although our jurisdiction derives from a provision of the new Constitution the constitutional
issues must be decided in terms of the interim Constitution. As mentioned earlier, the impugned
decisions were taken during December 1994 when the interim Constitution was in force and this
Court has already accepted the principle asserted by the Constitutional Court (eg in S v Mhlungu
and Others 1995(3) SA 867 (CC) and Du Plessis and Others v De Klerk and Another 1996(3) SA
850 (CC)) that the lawfulness or unlawfulness of conduct is determined by the applicable law at
the time it took place (see National Media Ltd and Others v Bogoshi 1998(4) SA 1196 (SCA) at
1218F-H).
[8] In view of the way in which administrative justice was dealt with in the interim Constitution, a
problem which should perhaps be addressed first, is whether an administrative decision may still
be reviewed on common law grounds. I find it convenient, however, to consider this question after
an examination of the nature and merits of the respondents’ complaints.
[9] The Commissioner’s decisions which form the subject matter of the appeals were taken under
s 99(2)(a) of the Customs and Excise Act 91 of 1964, as amended, which in effect renders agents
liable for the obligations of their principals. The respondents are clearing agents and the effect of
the Commissioner’s decisions was to hold them liable for the unpaid customs duties and other
charges in respect of goods which had been landed in Durban where they were cleared for export
to Mozambique. For a proper understanding of the facts and of s 99(2)(a) itself, it is necessary to
deal in some detail with the clearing process and the provisions of the Act relating to goods which
are landed in South Africa for delivery at a place beyond the borders of the common customs
area. The Act was amended in several respects after the events which gave rise to the review
proceedings and the relevant provisions will be rendered in their erstwhile form.
[10] What is known in ordinary language as ""customs clearance"", is referred to in the Act as ""due
entry"". Within a prescribed period after goods are imported the importer is required to make due
entry thereof in the prescribed form. This is done by submitting a bill of entry containing
particulars inter alia of the goods in question and the purpose for which they are being entered, to
the Controller (an official designated by the Commissioner for a particular area). At the same
time, unless the Controller allows a deferment, the duties due on the goods must be paid. If the
Controller is satisfied, a release order is issued. Goods entered for home consumption are
presumably released without further ado; what happens to them thereafter does not concern us.

Goods destined for a neighbouring country may be entered either for removal in bond (s 18) of for
storage in a customs and excise warehouse (s 18A) whence they may later be removed upon
due entry for export. In either case, if they are destined for a place beyond the borders of the
common customs area, there is an immediately liability to pay the duty but actual payment thereof
is conditional upon it being proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the goods have
been duly taken out of the area. If proof is furnished within the prescribed time, the liability
ceases; if not, the duty is payable on demand. Goods removed in bond or for export from a
customs and excise warehouse may not be diverted without the permission of the Commissioner
to any destination other than the one declared on entry.
[11] During March 1992 the Commissioner demanded from each respondent payment of the
duties and other charges allegedly due in respect of goods which had been diverted contrary to
the provisions of ss 18 and 18A. How the demands came about emerges from what follows.
(a) It was the parctice of the Controller in Durban to accept copies of bills of entry, officially signed
and stamped at the border posts, as proof that the goods reflected therein had been removed
from the common customs area. This practice continued for many years without there being any
suspicion that it was being abused until a customs official happened to notice an apparently
irregular stamp on one of the returned documents. An investigation followed which eventually
revealed that fraud had been committed on a massive scale in connection with goods cleared in
Durban for export beyond the borders of the common customs area. Although it could not be
determined how the fraud was perpetrated, it became clear inter alia that the stamps and
signatures on some of the returned bills of entry were counterfeit and that the goods had never
left the common customs area. In 41 such cases the clearing had been done by Conlog and in
two others by Renfreight.
(b) Every bill of entry contains the name of, and is signed by someone on behalf of the importer or
exporter or remover who certifies that the particulars therein are true and correct and comply with
the provisions of the Customs and Excise Act. In the 41 cases referred to, the bills were signed
by a Conlog representative who described himself as the agent for the remover although in each
one Conlog’s name also appeared as remover. The two other bills were signed by a Renfreight
representative who described himself as the agent for the exporter but Renfreight’s name also
appeared therein as exporter.
(c) In terms of ss 18(6) and 18A(5) no entry for removal in bond or for export from a customs and
excise warehouse may be accepted from a person who has not furnished security to the
satisfaction of the Commissioner. Both respondents had standing security arrangements with the
Commissioner which they used, not only for their own benefit, but also to assist smaller clearing
agents who could not afford such a facility. According to the uncontested evidence it was
common practice for large operators to allow smaller ones to utilize their services and bond
facilities at a nominal fee. In such cases the former would complete the bills on information
supplied by the smaller operators, and would then handle the clearance. In all the 41 cases
mentioned earlier Conlog’s clearing instructions came from a company referred to in the papers
as Access Freight with which Conlog used to do this type of business. In the other two cases
Renfreight’s instructions came from a concern referred to in the papers as Anglo Dynamic. (There
is no suggestion of the involvement of either Access Freight or Anglo Dynamic in the fraud.)
[12] After receipt of the demands the respondents’ attorneys sought to persuade the
Commissioner that the respondents had acted all along as agents whose liability had to be
determined in terms of s 99(2)(a). Initially their attempts failed; but, after the respondents had
commenced proceedings in the Durban and Coast Local Division for a declaratory order and
interim relief and after he had taken legal advice, the Commissioner changed his mind and wrote
to the respondents’ attorneys:

""I have come to the conclusion that the provisions of Section 99(2)(a) of the Act may be
applicable, depending on whether your clients acted as agents or as principal. If your clients were
agents, then on this basis they are also liable. I have accordingly resolved that I am obliged to
give the matters raised in the proviso to Section 99(2)(a) consideration, accepting (without
deciding) for the purposes thereof that your clients acted as agents and not as principal ...Your
clients are hereby invited to make such further written representations to me as you deem
desirable in this regard.""
[13] Further representations followed and the Commissioner eventually notified the respondents
of his decision. In both cases the reasons were the same. They appear in the following extracts
from the letter which Conlog received:
""It is customary, and is indeed practice, to accept that there exists a relationship of trust between
licensed clearing agents and my Office, and I have always accepted the position to be so and
have arranged the day to day administration of my Office based on such understanding. To hold
otherwise would require the physical examination of every consignment of goods imported into or
exported out of the Republic. This, in turn, would render the effective administration of imports
and exports quite impossible. The cost of administration would become prohibitively high and the
delays caused would seriously inhibit the flow of trade. Furthermore, this Office does not possess,
and was never possessed, of a large enough personnel to facilitate such extensive physical
examination of all consignments.
Clearing agents licences are issued annually in terms of the provisions of the Act. Every such
agent, including Conlog, must annually submit a form styled: ‘Application for licensing as a
clearing agent in terms of Section 64B(2) of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964.’ Such application
forms are duly completed signed and delivered to the relevant Controller.
Paragraph 8.1 of the application form, inter alia, provides as follows:
‘The applicant undertakes to institute adequate administrative measures to ensure that -
(a) the contents of all documentation submitted to the office are duly verified;’
Conlog has signed such applications every year. This office expects that clearing agents will
honour their undertakings...
Having carefully considered the representations made by and on behalf of Conlog and the
content of the papers before Court referred to hereinbefore, I have not been satisfied that Conlog
took all reasonable steps to prevent the non-fulfilment contemplated in section 99(2)(a) of the Act.
In this regard I paid particular attention to the facts and allegations set out at pages 16 to 20 of
Conlog‘s representations dated 13 July 1994. It struck me as particularly significant that Conlog
made no reference to the relationship of trust that exists between my Office on the one hand and
clearing and forwarding agents on the other hand. Conlog has failed to convince me that any
effort was made by it to ensure that the particulars on the Bills of Entry were indeed correct. In
particular Conlog did not endeavour to ascertain whether the purported consignees of the goods
in the declared country of destination even existed, or were in truth the consignees, or even
received the goods. No proof or evidence of any steps taken by Conlog in this regard was
submitted for my consideration. Nor did Conlog attempt to prove that payment for the goods had
been made and were received in the RSA. The body of evidence before me, taken as a whole,
suggests that Conlog has instituted no or inadequate administrative measures to ensure that the
contents of all documentation submitted to Customs are duly verified.""

[14] The respondents’ case is essentially that the Commissioner did not properly apply his mind
to the question which he had to decide. In order to consider the validity of their contention it is
necessary to deal briefly with s 99(2)(a). It reads as follows:
""An agent appointed by any importer, exporter, manufacturer, licensee, remover of goods in bond
... shall be liable for the fulfilment, in respect of the matter in question, of all obligations, including
the payment of duty and charges, imposed on such importer, exporter ... remover of goods in
bond ... by this Act and to any penalties ... which may be incurred in respect of that matter:
Provided that such agent ... shall cease to be so liable if he proves to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner that -
(i) he was not a party to the non-fulfilment by any such importer, exporter ... remover of goods in
bond or other principal, of any such obligation;
(ii) when he became aware of such non-fulfilment, he notified the Controller thereof as soon as
practicable; and
(iii) all reasonable steps were taken by him to prevent such non-fulfilment.""
[15] Of the three requirements of the proviso only the third is relevant because the Commissioner
accepted that the other two had been met. The words ""such non-fulfilment"" in par (iii) plainly
refers back to the non-fulfilment of a principal’s obligation mentioned in the main part of the
provision and in par (i). Although the section renders an agent generally liable for all his
principal’s obligations in terms of the Act, it is clear that the proviso relates in any given case only
to the unfulfilled obligation in that case. It follows that the question in the enquiry under par (iii)
must in every case be whether the agent has taken all reasonable steps to prevent the non-
fulfilment of the particular obligation which the principal has not fulfilled.
There was some debate in this Court on the question whether an exporter or remover is legally
obliged under ss 18 and 18A to take the goods in question out of the common customs area.
Obviously, his liability to pay the duty is not extinguished if he fails to do so, but it does not
necessarily follow that he has a positive obligation to remove the goods for which his agent may
be liable under s 99(2)(a). The Court a quo found that neither s 18 nor s 18A creates such an
obligation, but on the view that I take of the matter, it is not necessary to decide whether this is
correct. It must be stressed, however, that the Commissioner’s case was presented to this Court
on the basis that the respondents are liable for their principals’ obligation to remove the goods
from the common customs area. What the Commissioner accordingly had to decide was whether
they had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the diversion of the goods.
[16] A striking feature of the reasons for the decision is the emphasis on the respondents’
undertakings to institute adequate administrative measures. I pause to say that, in the letter to the
respondents’ attorneys inviting them to make representations for purposes of s 99(2)(a), the
Commissioner listed the documents which he would take into consideration. The respondents’
license applications did not appear in the list; but, after he had received the representations, the
Commissioner sent copies of the applications to the respondents’ attorneys and informed them
that he intended taking the contents thereof into account as well. His sudden interest in these
documents is explained by the particular significance which he attached to the relationship of trust
and by the concluding sentence of the quotation in par [13] which leave the reader in no doubt
that the Commissioner simply held the respondents to their undertakings. Such an approach was
plainly wrong. What he had to decide, was not whether the respondents had complied with their
undertakings, but whether they had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the diversion of the
goods. I say this because the enquiry under par (iii) is directed at the reasonableness of an
agent’s conduct and the mere fact that he has not complied with an undertaking to take adequate

measures to ensure the accuracy of documents submitted to the Controller can obviously not be
conclusive.
[17] Moreover, reasonableness in the context of par (iii) must be determined, as the
reasonableness of conduct has to be determined in many other fields of the law, by an objective
standard. Since the conduct of a member of the clearing and forwarding industry was under
consideration, the Commissioner had to take account of the customary functions of clearing
agents. Apart from the respondents’ own allegations about the customs of the industry, there is a
supporting affidavit by Mr AJ Cowell before us. According to Mr Cowell (who has been active in
clearing and forwarding for forty nine years), a clearing agent’s function is ""to pass the necessary
documentation in respect of clearing goods""; what is expected of him, is a verification of
documents from documents, that is to say, the contents of documents submitted to the Controller
must accord with the contents of documents in the agent’s possession; in all transactions the
agent ""relies on the honesty and integrity of those persons supplying the information needed to
prepare and submit the necessary documentation""; for various reasons, it is unreasonable and
contrary to the general methods accepted world wide to expect of an agent to make enquiries in
other countries to verify the existence and identity of the consignor and consignee; and the
Commissioner has never in the past required such enquiries to be made. This was admittedly
said in an affidavit attached to the respondents’ replying affidavits but the Commissioner did not
seek leave to reply nor did he apply to have the affidavit struck out. The allegations stand
uncontradicted and are supported by s 64B(2) of the Act which provides that
""[t]he Commissioner may, subject to such conditions as he may in each case impose, license any
person applying therefor and approved by him, as a clearing agent for making entry of or
delivering a bill of entry relating to, goods on behalf of an importer or exporter of goods,
as the case may be."" (Emphasis added.)
No mention is made of any obligation apart from making entry and delivering a bill of entry. The
Commissioner was aware of the customary procedures in the industry: he is an experienced
customs official himself and what the respondents claimed to be the functions of clearing agents
was brought to his attention in the correspondence before he took the decision. The fact that he
did not even mention this aspect of the matter in the reasons for his decision strengthens the
impression that he concerned himself with the respondents’ undertakings and with very little else.
[18] There is another consideration which he did not mention and must be taken to have
overlooked. The Commissioner has wide powers under ss 18(7) and 18A(6) of the Act to control
exports by prescribing whatever terms he may wish, and the Controller is entitled under s 39(1)(c)
to demand
""invoices as prescribed ... a copy of the confirmation of sale or other contract of purchase of sale,
importer’s written clearing instructions ... and such other documents relating to such goods as
[he] may require in each case""
and in addition may require the person making an entry to
""answer all such questions relating to such goods as may be put to him by the Controller ...""
But these powers were never exercised. The impression is irresistible that the insistence on the
positive verification by active enquiry of the particulars in bills of entry stemmed from the benefit
of hindsight. In the letters to the respondents the Commissioner speaks of the practice of
accepting the returned bills of entry as proof that goods had left the common customs area, as
""the time honoured practice of this office, dating back to long before I had become the incumbent
thereof"". ""These acquittal documents"", he says, ""were accepted on the same basis of trust as the
bills of entry had previously been accepted."" What he did not say, is that clearing agents were in

precisely the same position and relied as heavily on the honesty of their customers as he did on
theirs. The fact of the matter is simply that for many years no-one in the industry or in the
Commissioner’s office suspected that the practice was open to abuse and that there might be a
need for additional measures. Therefore: how can it possibly be said that the respondents relied
unreasonably on the integrity of the system? Neither the Commissioner nor the Controller
foresaw that the system could fail; and if seasoned customs officials like these did not foresee it,
why should clearing agents have done so? There is no answer to these questions in the
Commissioner’s reasons, nor, for that matter in his opposing affidavit.
[19] For these reasons it is clear to me that the Commissioner did not apply his mind properly to
the question before him. Had there not been constitutional complications the appeals would have
been relatively simple because there could have been no doubt that a common law review should
succeed (cf Johannesburg Stock Exchange and Another v Witwatersrand Nigel Ltd and Another
1988(3) SA 132 (A) at 152A-D). But, as mentioned earlier, there may be a question about the
availability of common law grounds for review in view of the way in which the interim Constitution
dealt with administrative justice. Counsel were agreed that the common law on the subject was
not abolished but, because the question is important, I shall deal with it.
[20] In the Fedsure case the Constitutional Court only dealt with the interplay between the interim
Constitution and the common law relating to administrative action in the context of the jurisdiction
of the Appellate Division. As explained in paras [101] and [102] of the judgment of the plurality
every administrative action has to be consistent with s 24 of the interim Constitution, that is to say
it has to be lawful and procedurally fair. However, I agree with the view which Professors Du
Plessis and Corder expressed in Understanding South Africa’s Transitional Bill of Rights at 170
that ""s 24 does not purport to constitutionalize judicial review in its fulness.""
Judicial review under the Constitution and under the common law are different concepts. In the
field of administrative law constitutional review is concerned with the constitutional legality of
administrative action, the question in each case being whether it is or is not consistent with the
Constitution, and the only criterion being the Constitution itself. Judicial review under the common
law is essentially also concerned with the legality of administrative action but the question in each
case is whether the action under consideration is in accordance with the behests of the
empowering statute and the requirements of natural justice. The enquiry in this regard is not
governed by a single criterion. The grounds for review which the courts have developed over the
years can never be regarded as a numerus clausus for the simple reason that administrative law
is not static. As new notions develop and take root, so must new measures be devised to control
the exercise of administrative functions. In South Africa this is particularly true in view of the
requirement of s 35(3) of the interim Constitution that any law be interpreted, and that the
common law be applied and developed, with due regard to the spirit, purport and objects of the
Bill of Rights.
I cannot imagine that the intention was to do away with this type of review. No doubt
administrative action which is not in accordance with the behests of the empowering legislation, is
unlawful and therefore unconstitutional, and action which does not meet the requirements of
natural justice is procedurally unfair and therefore equally unconstitutional. But, although it is
difficult to conceive of a case where the question of legality cannot ultimately be reduced to a
question of constitutionality, it does not follow that the common law grounds for review have
ceased to exist. What is lawful and procedurally fair within the purview of s 24 is for the courts to
decide and I have little doubt that, to the extent that there is no inconsistency with the
Constitution, the common law grounds for review were intended to remain intact. There is no
indication in the interim Constitution of an intention to bring about a situation in which, once a
court finds that administrative action was not in accordance with the empowering legislation or the
requirements of natural justice, interference is only permissible on constitutional grounds. On the
contrary, s 35(3) is a strong indication that it was the intention, not to abolish any branch of the
common law, but to leave it to the courts to bring it into conformity with the spirit, purport and

objects of the Bill of Rights. S 33(3) which proclaims that the entrenchment of rights shall not be
construed as denying the existence of any other rights conferred by common law which are not
inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, points the same way.
[21] In the present case I have found that the Commissioner did not apply his mind properly to the
question before him. At common law such a finding provides sufficient reason to set the decision
aside and I find it unnecessary to consider whether it also falls foul of s 24 of the interim
Constitution. I also find it unnecessary to deal with the Court a quo’s judgment. Although I have
followed a different route, I am of the view that the conclusion that the decision had to be
rescinded, was correct.
[22] It is necessary to record in conclusion that we condoned the Commissioner’s failure to file the
record in terms of the Rule at the hearing of the appeal, and that we ordered him to pay the costs
occasioned by the application for condonation.
The appeals are according dismissed with costs including the costs of two counsel.

CASE NUMBER 459/97

In the matter between:

and

The State

Respondent

CORAM: Smalberger, Schutz, JJA et Madlanga AJA

Date of Hearing: 11 May 1999

Date of Judgment: 18 May 1999

JUDGMENT

MADLANGA AJA:

BACKGROUND

[1] The appellant and eleven co-accused appeared before van Rensburg J and two
assessors in the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court charged with three counts of
murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of arson. On 16 August 1996 the
appellant was convicted on all five counts, the court finding that in respect of the murder
and attempted murder counts mens rea was in the form of dolus eventualis. All his co-
accused were acquitted on all the counts. The murder counts were treated as one for
purposes of sentence and in respect thereof the appellant was sentenced to twenty years
imprisonment. On the attempted murder and arson counts he was sentenced to eight years
and five years imprisonment respectively. It was ordered that the latter two sentences run
concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of the murder counts.

[2] van Rensburg J granted the appellant leave to appeal to this court against his
conviction on all the counts.

[3] On 5 November 1994 at about midnight a group of men attacked premises situate at
144B Vellem Street, Joza, Grahamstown (""144B""). At these premises there was a main
house and, at the back, a detached outbuilding and a toilet. The outbuilding consisted of
three rooms. Initially the object of the attack was the outbuilding. Some of the attackers
climbed onto the roof of the outbuilding, removed a corrugated iron sheet, poured petrol
into the outbuilding through the opening in the roof and then set the outbuilding alight.
All the while, those of the attackers who had remained on the ground were pelting the
outbuilding with stones. Inside the outbuilding there were six men, amongst whom were
Fikile Booi and Tandile Anthony Manyati. Once the outbuilding was ablaze, the six men
ran out and hurriedly entered the main house through a broken window. The attackers
immediately directed their attack at the main house. They threw stones at it and set it
alight, again using petrol. Of the six men who had come from the outbuilding and other
people who had been sleeping in the main house, a great many ran away and escaped the
fire. Not so fortunate were Akhona Ngeju, a three year old boy and Tandile Anthony
Manyati, a twenty-five year old man. These two were incinerated in the house and they
are the deceased in the second and third murder counts respectively. The deceased in the
first murder count, Fikile Booi, managed to escape from the burning house but died a few
days later as a result of burns sustained in the fire. Four of the men who had been in the
outbuilding when the attack started survived. The attempted murder count relates to them.

[4] The events set out above were not disputed at the trial. The main issue was the
identity of the persons who launched the attack. Insofar as the appellant is concerned, that
continues to be an issue before this court. A further issue is whether the appellant acted in
concert with the group of attackers - whether common purpose was established. I proceed
to deal with these two issues.

IDENTIFICATION

(a) The evidence

[5] A number of persons witnessed the attack at 144B. However, the trial court relied on
the evidence of only two of these eyewitnesses, Nonkululeko Eunice Ngeju
(""Nonkululeko"") and Luyanda Ntamo (""Luyanda""). Its judgment sufficiently and
correctly sets out the reasons for rejecting the evidence of the remaining witnesses and of
this I need say no more. In setting out the evidence of Nonkululeko and Luyanda, I shall
deal only with the instances involving their identification of the appellant.

[6] Whilst sleeping in a bedroom of the main house at 144B, Nonkululeko was awakened
by the noise of an impact on the bedroom window. The window broke. She rushed to the
sitting room. Through its window she saw people entering the premises. Though saying
that she did not see these people clearly, she claims that they were the appellant, accused
6 to 9, accused 11 and other persons who were not charged. At a later stage she went
back to the bedroom where she had been sleeping. The window of this bedroom is at the
back and thus faced the outbuilding. Nonkululeko peeped through this window. She saw
(clearly this time) accused 2 and 3 on the roof of the outbuilding. The appellant, accused
4 to 10 and a certain Boyboy (not one of the accused) were on the ground throwing
stones at the outbuilding. Nonkululeko also testified that she had known the appellant for
a long time prior to the attack (""van lankal af""). She used to visit a certain house in the
vicinity of the appellant’s home and on such occasions she would see the appellant at his
home.

[7] Luyanda was amongst the six men who were in the outbuilding. Whilst they were
there, an object struck the door, which flew open. Just outside the outbuilding he saw a
group of people. Others were in a dirt road nearby (Vellem Street being a tarred street).
One of the six shut the door. Luyanda, using an inside door, went to an adjoining room.
He peeped through a hole in the door leading outside and saw that the appellant was
amongst the people in front of the outbuilding. These people were pelting the outbuilding
with stones. After escaping into the main house, he hid behind a wardrobe. While hiding
there he could see outside through a window. His evidence is not clear as to which
window this was. Through it he saw the appellant moving about. After he had eventually
got out of the main house, the police called him to their van. They asked him to identify a
person inside the van. They shone a torch on his face. Luyanda identified him as one of
the attackers. That person was the appellant. Luyanda and the appellant were
acquaintances and shared two mutual friends, Nqoyi and Zola. Luyanda had a girlfriend,
Nqabisa, whose home was in the same passageway (""gang"") as the appellant’s home. As
at the date of the attack, he had known the appellant for two years. During that period he
used to see the appellant fairly regularly.

[8] Constable Tamboer, a detective (""Tamboer""), testified that at about 1h20 on 6
November 1994 he and Detective Sergeant de Jongh (""de Jongh"") received a telephonic

report concerning the incident at 144B. They drove there, de Jongh being the driver.
According to de Jongh, whose evidence is dealt with later, they drove in a sedan. As they
approached the scene, they travelled from east to west in Vellem Street. Before the motor
vehicle stopped, Tamboer saw a man on the roof of an outbuilding of the premises
adjacent to 144B. From the roof, the man jumped over a fence and landed in the yard of
adjoining premises (i.e. two premises to the east of 144B). The man immediately ran
away in an easterly direction within the premises alongside Vellem Street. As their motor
vehicle was coming to a standstill, Tamboer got out and gave chase, running in Vellem
Street parallel to the man he was pursuing. Just before the corner of Vellem Street and a
dirt road, the man disappeared behind a house. When Tamboer reached the corner of the
two streets, he saw the man jump over the wall of the second house from the corner
(down the dirt road) into the yard. From the time the man disappeared behind the house
to the time Tamboer saw him again only about four seconds had elapsed. The man
disappeared behind the wall. Tamboer went down the dirt road and looked inside the yard
but did not see him. On continuing his search, and next to this yard, he found the man
lying on his stomach between a wall and a motor vehicle. From the time the man jumped
over the wall to the time he was found about one to two minutes had elapsed. This man
was the appellant. Tamboer testified that although he could not recall what the appellant’s
attire was, the attire of the man he had seen jump from the roof and that of the man he
found between the wall and the motor vehicle was the same. He arrested the appellant. At
that stage de Jongh joined him. On taking the appellant back to 144B, they found that a
number of other police vehicles and firemen had arrived. They placed the appellant in the
back of a police van. He was the only person in that van. In fact, he was the only person
arrested at the scene. On the way back to the charge office their sedan and the van in
which the appellant was followed each other. Tamboer next saw the appellant when he
was called to testify at the trial. A somewhat strange feature of Tamboer’s evidence is
that when he and de Jongh arrived back at the charge office, he went straight to the
detectives’ offices and did not enter the charge office to see to the booking in and locking
up of the appellant. This should be contrasted with what appears in the summary of the
evidence of de Jongh and Sergeant Kiti (""Kiti"").

[9] de Jongh testified that on arrival at 144B he saw a man jump over a fence of a
neighbouring yard. He also saw six to eight people run out of the yard of 144B. About
two other people who were already in the street when he first saw them also ran away. As
he was stopping the motor vehicle, Tamboer jumped out and ran down Vellem Street in
the direction whence they had come. According to standing police instructions, police
partners are supposed to ""stick with"" each other and provide each other with backup. For
that reason, as soon as de Jongh had stopped the motor vehicle, he followed Tamboer at a
distance of about ten to fifteen metres. At that stage he could only see Tamboer. He did
not know what had become of the man who had jumped over the fence. After they had
turned into the dirt road, he saw Tamboer look inside certain premises surrounded by a
brick wall. Tamboer quickly came out and went around a motor vehicle which was
parked in the driveway of these premises and pulled the appellant from the ground.

[10] As will appear later, it is necessary to describe these premises. Photograph 8 of
Exhibit ""B"", an aerial photograph, fairly depicts these premises. The one side of the brick

wall extends in a straight line right from the wall of the house itself towards the dirt road.
The wall then forms a 90° turn so that it stands in front of the house. About halfway
down the length of what appears to be a very big house (it may be two houses which are
not detached but nothing turns on this) the wall again turns at 90° and stretches towards,
and makes contact with, the house. There is thus an enclosed yard infront of this first
portion of the house. The remaining half of the big house (if not the second house)
extends parallel to the last-mentioned portion of the wall towards the dirt road, so that
there is a passage between this part of the house and that portion of the wall. This passage
extends from very close to the dirt road right up to the house itself. It is this passage
which has been referred to as a driveway. The clear impression created by this scene is
that if the front door/s of the house/s was/were locked (which must have been the case at
that time of the night), the only way anybody who found himself in the enclosed front
yard or in the driveway could have left the premises was by going onto the road in front.
According to Tamboer’s evidence, the man he saw jump over the wall would have landed
in the enclosed yard. The significance of this is dealt with later.

[11] de Jongh further testified that they arrested the appellant and took him to 144B
where they placed him in the back of a police van which, together with other police
vehicles and fire engines, had since arrived. At the scene he met and spoke to Luyanda
who claimed to have witnessed the attack. He took Luyanda to the back of the van and
shone a torch in the appellant’s face. Luyanda confirmed that the appellant was one of the
attackers. Much later they left for the charge office where de Jongh instructed Tamboer
(who complied) to attend to the booking in and locking up of the appellant whilst he (de
Jongh) remained in the charge office attending to other duties. His evidence also confirms
that only one person was arrested that night. Other suspects were only arrested a few days
thereafter. Under cross-examination he said that he could not tell whether the man he saw
jump over a fence was the appellant. He also said that he never saw anybody on top of a
roof.

[12] During the night of 5 and 6 November 1994 Kiti was in charge of the police cells at
the police station which is at Beaufort Street, Grahamstown. He personally made an entry
in the occurrence book concerning the arrest and locking up of the appellant. He
confirmed that it was Tamboer who had the appellant locked up and who signed for the
entry made by him. The entry makes specific mention of the appellant’s name. It was the
appellant himself who gave his name to Kiti.

[13] The appellant’s version was that he was coming from his sister’s home very late at
night. He saw smoke and heard motor vehicles making a noise - under cross-examination
he seemed to accept that the noise was that of sirens. He decided to go to the place where
the smoke was, which was at 144B. On arrival there he stood on the pavement opposite
144B. After a very short while he departed homeward bound. Whilst walking on a dirt
road which is some distance from the one Tamboer and de Jongh claim to have arrested
him beside (in fact in roughly the opposite direction), a police van approached him from
behind. It stopped and police got out, walked up to him and arrested him. None of these
police was either Tamboer or de Jongh. In fact, he never saw Tamboer and de Jongh at all
that night. When cross-examining Kiti, he went so far as to suggest that the person

brought to the charge office by Tamboer and who gave his name as Sandile Gqabi (the
appellant’s name) must have been somebody else. He was taken back to 144B. Whilst the
police van was parked there, a light was shone in his face. The light blinded him and he
could not tell who it was. All he heard was ""kumshaing"" (the speaking of a European
language or a derivative thereof which in this case could either have been English or
Afrikaans) and he did not understand what was said.

(b) Evaluation of the evidence

[14] Nonkululeko’s evidence is open to some criticism. The trial court held an inspection
in loco at 144B between 19h15 and 20h00 on 8 November 1995. Amongst others, the
findings were:

""1. Lighting:

(a) The external lighting in the area is furnished by three high-masts each with a battery
of lights affixed thereto;

(b) None of the masts is close to the premises at 144B Joza;

(c) At the back of the main house where the outbuilding, which was burnt down on the
night in question, was situated, the lighting cannot be described as good;

(d) The outbuilding which was burnt down has not been rebuilt and the area where the
outbuilding was situated is now simply a flat piece of ground;

(e) A large portion of the area at the rear of the main house where the outbuilding was
situated and between where the outbuilding was situated and the rear wall of the main
house was covered in shadow;

(f) The shadow was cast by the main house and the outside toilets standing at the rear of
the main house;

(g) On observation it was possible to identify a person some four metres away while
standing immediately outside the window of the bedroom at the rear of the main house if
he was known to you, but even then it required fairly close scrutiny;

(h) From our observations a witness would have experienced difficulty in identifying
someone who was not known to him from the said distance of four metres;

(i) It would appear that in all probability the outbuilding which was burnt down would
have cast further shadow in the four metre area between the rear of the main house and
the outbuilding;

(j) Visibility in the area in front of the main house at 144B Joza was markedly better.

2. The distance from the wall of the building on the roof of which constable Tamboer
said he saw a person standing and the fence over which the person jumped directly from
the roof is approximately 90 centimetres.""

From the aforegoing it is clear that between the bedroom window through which
Nonkululeko peeped and the outbuilding the lighting and visibility were not good. This is
the area where Nonkululeko claims to have seen the appellant. Secondly, as the appellant
was throwing stones at the outbuilding, he had his back to Nonkululeko, this minimising
chances of proper observation. The only times Nonkululeko could have seen the
appellant’s face (or at the very least the side of his face) were when, according to
Nonkululeko, the appellant was standing at an angle in relation to the bedroom window.
A suggestion by Nonkululeko that at some stage the appellant faced her squarely and that
she then had a good view of his face seems to be an afterthought and I shall say no more
of it. Thirdly, the scene was a moving one. She said, ""... hulle het hier op en af beweeg.""
Later on she added, ""Nee dit was net ‘n deurmekaarspul."" Fourthly, she was frightened.
To a degree, all of these militate against proper identification.

[15] Save for the fact that as Luyanda was peeping through the hole in the door of the
outbuilding the appellant was facing him (as opposed to giving his back to him),
Luyanda’s evidence may be criticised on similar grounds to Nonkululeko’s. Indeed, the
trial court did level criticism at the evidence of these two witnesses. The trial court was
quite alive to the inherent dangers attendant upon their testimony. In addition to the
criticism raised above the trial court considered a few more grounds for criticism which
in its view added to the necessity for circumspection. I need not discuss these other
factors any further. Suffice it to say that because of the cumulative effect of all these
factors, the trial court, quite correctly in my view, treated the evidence of Nonkululeko
and Luyanda with extreme caution. The court went so far as to suggest that in all
likelihood a verdict of guilty could not have been returned had it not been for the
evidence of the police witnesses. It is, therefore, necessary to consider to what extent the
evidence of the police assists the State case.

[16] The evidence of de Jongh clearly suggests that the attack was not yet over when he
and Tamboer arrived at the scene. This is deduced from the fact that about six or eight
people and about two others ran away from the yard of 144B and the street respectively
as soon as the two policemen arrived. These people must have been part of the group that
was launching the attack. It would be fanciful to suggest that those people were either
onlookers or people who had either come to offer assistance or were there for any other
lawful purpose. The fact of running away discounts any such possibility. Further, the fact

that all ten or so of the people ran away once the police arrived dispels any possible
suggestion that some people may have run away from the police for any number of
reasons, even if not guilty of any wrongdoing. It is worth noting that at the same time
Tamboer saw one person jump from the roof and also run away.

[17] The evidence has revealed that in the vicinity where de Jongh witnessed the act of
jumping over a fence Tamboer saw a man jump from a roof and over the same fence as
that referred to by de Jongh. The attack at 144B was characterised by the throwing of
stones and the climbing onto the roofs of both the outbuilding and the main house. The
record of the trial court’s observations at the inspection in loco which has already been
referred to also indicates that the roof of the main house at 144B was so close to the roof
of the adjoining house at 145B which, in turn, was so close to the roof of the outbuilding
at 145B, that a person could have walked from one roof to the next with ease. That being
so, and as the attack was still on when Tamboer and de Jongh arrived at the scene, the
inference is inescapable that the man who jumped from the roof over a fence was one of
the attackers. This is fortified by the fact that he escaped from the scene at the same time
as the other ten or so people already mentioned. That he was on top of a roof at 145B and
not at 144B is no answer to this conclusion because, as already indicated above, 144B
was quite close by and movement from roof to roof in the course of the attack presented
no difficulty. In my view, the suggestion by Mr Glover who appeared for the appellant
that an innocent bystander could have decided to climb the roof of the outbuilding at
145B so as to have a good view of what was happening is so fanciful as to require no
further comment.

[18] Mr Glover, in an attempt to distance the appellant from the man who had jumped
from the roof, submitted that the man de Jongh saw jump over the fence was not the same
as the one Tamboer saw jump from the roof. Inexplicably (but fortunately I do not have
to delve into this), he preferred the possibility that the appellant jumped from ground
level over the fence and that he was the man seen by de Jongh. He submitted that his
running away and hiding did not necessarily translate to guilt and that if it was the
appellant who was fleeing, he could have been fearful of the police purely because of his
long criminal record. The suggestion that two men jumped over the fence flies in the face
of the available and credible evidence. Tamboer, not being the driver, had an opportunity
to look and did look as the man jumped over the fence. He did not see another man jump
over that same fence from ground level. de Jongh, being the driver and still having to
bring the motor vehicle to a standstill, did not have as good an opportunity to observe
what was going on. Indeed, he was frank enough to say that he did not even see what the
man next did after he had jumped over the fence. Even when he followed Tamboer down
Vellem Street, the man was nowhere in sight. In my view, only one man jumped over the
fence and he jumped from the roof. de Jongh’s evidence can be explained on the basis
that he must have seen the man when he was already in the air and in the process of
jumping.

[19] In paragraph [17] above it has already been concluded that the man who jumped
from the roof was one of the attackers. It must next be considered whether that man was
the appellant. The man from the roof disappeared from Tamboer’s view for the first time

when he ran behind a house at the corner of Vellem Street and the dirt road. This
disappearance lasted only about four seconds. The man disappeared again when he
jumped over the wall of the premises described in paragraph [10] above. This
disappearance lasted no more than one to two minutes. The position in which Tamboer
found the appellant suggests that he was hiding. As appears from the description given
above, short of getting inside the house (which, because of the hour, seems unlikely
unless the person was not only known but was also welcome), there was no route of
escape once the man jumped into the enclosed yard. The only way out was the dirt road
by which the police were approaching. The man was thus cornered. Attempting to hide
between the wall and the motor vehicle was the man’s failed and last resort. According to
Tamboer, the clothing of the man who jumped from the roof and that of the man he
arrested was the same. The cumulative effect of all these factors leads to the conclusion
that the man who jumped from the roof and the appellant are one and the same person. To
conclude this part of the debate, I must mention that Mr Glover accepted that the
appellant was untruthful about where, and by whom, he was arrested. He thus accepted
that he was the man arrested by Tamboer in the presence of de Jongh. This concession, in
my view, was correctly made. It thus becomes unnecessary to deal with what I referred to
as a strange feature in Tamboer’s evidence, and that is the question of who it is that
booked the appellant in at the charge office. If there had been some semblance of truth in
the appellant’s version, it would have been necessary to deal with this aspect of
Tamboer’s evidence to establish a clear contemporaneous chain of events culminating in
the appellant being locked up in the cells so as to discount any possibility that the
appellant was arrested elsewhere and by other police officers. Suffice it to say that this
strange feature of Tamboer’s evidence may be explained by a lapse in memory
occasioned by the long time lapse (about two years) from the time of the appellant’s
arrest to the time Tamboer testified in court. I did not understand Mr Glover to be
questioning the credibility of Tamboer and de Jongh.

[20] Regard being had to the fact that all that the trial court found is that there was a risk
that Nonkululeko and Luyanda were mistaken in their identification of the appellant (and
not that they were mendacious or dishonest), such risk is eliminated by the cogent
corroborative evidence of Tamboer and de Jongh. The evidence against the appellant thus
amounted to so strong a case that in the absence of a reasonably possibly true explanation
his guilt had to follow. Is there a reasonably possibly true explanation?

[21] With the aid of aerial photographs the appellant mapped out where he was coming
from and where he was when he first saw the smoke at 144B. Even though no
measurements were given, it seems that this was quite a long way off. Appellant also
indicated where his home was. In moving from where he first noticed the smoke towards
144B he was going away from his home. To go all that way, leaving his home behind in
the dead of night, he must have been extremely curious and intent on seeing what was
going on at 144B. Strangely enough, he testified that on arrival at the scene, he stood for
a short while and left. When cross-examined on his observations at the scene he was very
evasive. He said that on arrival he observed that there were motor vehicles. When asked
whether any of these were police vehicles or fire engines, he said that, because he did not
stay for long, he could not tell. Further, in answer to the question as to what he found

going on at the scene, he said that he did not know and that the reason for this was again
the fact of departure soon after arrival. It eventually became clear that in essence at the
scene the appellant took particular note of only the smoke and fire, something very
strange for somebody who had come a long way apparently intent on looking on. Without
going any further, the appellant’s version was correctly rejected. The submission by Mr
Glover that lies do not necessarily translate to guilt is misplaced. As indicated above, a
strong case which can only be displaced by a reasonably possibly true explanation exists
without any reliance on the appellant’s untruthful testimony. In no way does this
approach offend against the principle set out in S v Mtsweni 1985 (1) SA 590 (A).

COMMON PURPOSE

[22] If I understood Mr Glover correctly, his submission under this point related to
whether the appellant was shown to have been associated with the attackers. A short
answer to this is that this enquiry is sufficiently dealt with in paragraphs [16] to [19]
above. That the appellant only ran away from the scene at the tail end of the events, and
only because of the arrival of the police, sufficiently demonstrates his association with
the acts of the group that launched the attack. Therefore, in the absence of evidence
tending to show that he ever dissociated himself from the group which launched the
attack in a manner which recklessly disregarded the real possibility of the death of people
who were in the outbuilding and the main house, he, in my view, is guilty of murder and
attempted murder. He is also guilty of arson. The group of attackers went to 144B with
the obvious intention of attacking in the manner already described. That they were
recklessly careless as to whether the death of people in the premises ensued sufficiently
demonstrates dolus eventualis.

[23] This appeal is not only purely factual but, as appears from the aforegoing debate, the
factual issues raised in it are by no means complex or of such importance as to warrant
the attention of this court. Accordingly, van Rensburg J should not have granted leave to
this court without any indication as to why such leave was not granted to the full court of
the Eastern Cape Division. In its present form the wording of section 315(2)(a) of the
Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 clearly enjoins a trial judge to first be satisfied that
the questions of law and of fact and other considerations involved in the appeal are of
such a nature that the appeal requires the attention of this court before he/she can grant
leave to this court. If he/she is not so satisfied, it is obligatory that leave be granted to the
full court of the division concerned. The absence of reasons on this issue makes it
difficult to understand why leave was granted to this court. Trial judges should always be
wary not to unnecessarily burden the roll of this court with appeals that may be
adequately disposed of by the full court of the division concerned (cf S v Myaka 1993 (2)
SACR 660 (A)).

[24] The appeal is dismissed.

DATE OF HEARING: 3 May 1999
DATE OF DELIVERY: 14 May 1999

J U D G M E N T

HOWIE JA:

The late Arthur Ralph Kaplan was a member of two pension funds managed by Liberty Life
Association of Africa Ltd (""Liberty Life""). In terms of the rules of the funds he nominated his
children (two minor sons) as the beneficiaries in respect of each fund in the event of his death.
He also created a trust for the benefit of each son. On his death in July 1990 he was survived by
three dependants - the two boys and his widow. (She is not their mother.) Liberty Life, instead of
acting in terms of the nominations, allocated the benefits payable by the funds to all three
dependants.
As a result, the joint trustees of each trust (to whom, it was common cause, the boys’ benefits
must be paid) sought an order in the High Court at Johannesburg, inter alia, declaring that the
benefits fell to be paid to them to the exclusion of the widow. The principal respondents cited
were the funds and Liberty Life. The deceased’s widow was also cited but she did not oppose
and has taken no part in the litigation. The matter was heard by Goldstein J who held that Liberty
Life, in apportioning the benefits as they did, acted in accordance with the law and the trustees
were therefore refused relief. With the leave of the Court below they appeal.
The judgment of the Court a quo is reported as Kaplan and Another NNO v Professional and
Executive Retirement Fund and Others 1998 (4) SA 1234 (W).
The funds in question are registered pension fund organisations in terms of the Pension Funds
Act 24 of 1956 (""the Act""). The Act does not deal with the manner of appointment of a fund
manager nor does it indicate who is eligible to be appointed. In various sections reference is
made to ""the person managing the business of the fund"" but ""person"" is merely defined as
""(including) any committee appointed to manage the affairs of a fund"". In the Interpretation Act 33
of 1957, however, ""person"" is defined as including any registered company. Liberty Life, a
registered insurance company, was therefore eligible to be appointed and was, as indicated
earlier, in fact appointed as manager of the business of the funds concerned.
The Act provides for a fund to have rules and the rules regulate, amongst other matters, the
conditions under which a member or other person may become entitled to a benefit (s 11(d)). The
rules of both funds enable a member to nominate beneficiaries to receive the due benefits in the
event of the member’s death. In the absence of a nomination the rules require that a deceased
member’s benefits be paid to dependants. Both the Act and the rules define the word
""dependant"" but it suffices to say for present purposes that the deceased’s sons and his widow -
his dependants at common law - are also dependants in terms of those definitions. It was
common cause throughout that the deceased’s nominations were validly made and that they
were accepted by the funds as made in accordance with the rules. It was also undisputed that,
but for the Act, the nominations would have entitled the sons to all the benefits and the trustees to
the relief claimed.
The crucial question, therefore, is whether the Act overrides the nominations.
The main argument for the trustees is that the Act does not. It is said that the nominations must
prevail because the Act does not cover the present situation.
Now the material terms of the Act are contained in s 37 C (1) as it read in 1990. Omitting
irrelevant wording, the subsection then provided as follows:
""(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any law or in the rules of a registered
fund, any benefit payable by such a fund in respect of a deceased member, shall . . . not form
part of the assets in the estate of such a member, but shall be dealt with in the following manner:

(a) If the fund within twelve months of the death of the member becomes aware of or traces a
dependant or dependants of the member, the benefit shall be paid to such dependant or, in such
proportions as may be deemed equitable by the person managing the business of the fund, to
such dependants.
(b) If the fund does not become aware of or cannot trace any dependant of the member within
twelve months of the death of the member, and the member has designated in writing to the fund
a nominee who is not a dependant of the member, to receive the benefit or such portion of the
benefit as is specified by the member in writing to the fund, the benefit or such portion of the
benefit shall be paid to such nominee: Provided that where the aggregate amount of the debts in
the estate of the member exceeds the aggregate amount of the assets in his estate, so much of
the benefit as is equal to the difference between such aggregate amount of debts and such
aggregate amount of assets shall be paid into the estate and the balance of such benefit or the
balance of such portion of the benefit as specified by the member in writing to the fund shall be
paid to the nominee.
(bA) . . .
(c) If the fund does not become aware of or cannot trace any dependant of the member within
twelve months of the death of the member and if the member has not designated a nominee or if
the member has designated a nominee to receive a portion of the benefit in writing to the fund,
the benefit or the remaining portion of the benefit after payment to the designated nominee, shall
be paid into the estate of the member, or, if no inventory in respect of the member has been
received by the Master of the Supreme Court in terms of section 9 of the Estates Act, 1965 (Act
No. 66 of 1965), into the Guardian’s Fund.""
The contention for the trustees put more specifically is this. The subsection aims to exclude from
the member’s estate only that which would otherwise have fallen within it. The nominations, it is
argued, constituted contracts for the benefit of third parties and their legal effect would have been
that the benefits in issue would not have fallen into the deceased’s estate. Therefore the benefits
were not assets to which the subsection applied.
To my mind this argument cannot succeed. There is nothing to convey the suggested limitation of
the subsection’s ambit to only such benefits as would otherwise have been assets in the estate.
The plain meaning of the subsection is this. All benefits payable in respect of a deceased
member, whether subject to a nomination or not, must be dealt with in terms of one or other of the
quoted subparagraphs. In other words none fall into the estate save in the circumstances stated
in subparagraphs (b) and (c). In addition, these nominations having been made in terms of the
rules, and the rules requiring the benefits to go to the nominated beneficiaries, the trustees’ case
is inextricably linked to the rules. However, as the phrase ""(n)otwithstanding anything to the
contrary . . . contained in the rules"" makes unmistakably clear, it matters not in the present
situation what the rules say — the benefits must be disposed of according to the subsection’s
statutory scheme.
In this case the benefits had to be disposed of in terms of s 37C (1)(a). They were.
The only other submission advanced in support of the appeal was that the division was
undertaken and effected in conflict with the rule delegatus delegare non potest.
It was not open to dispute on the papers that the Liberty Life employee who performed the
allocation was properly authorised by competent and authorised superiors within the company.
The argument was, however, that Liberty Life was itself a delegee and, therefore, in terms of the

maxim, incapable in law of delegating further. Alternatively, so it was submitted, if subdelegation
was in order then the employee concerned was inappropriately subordinate.
There is no merit in either contention. Assuming in the trustees’ favour, firstly, that the maxim
applies at all in the present context, secondly, that Liberty Life was indeed a delegee, and, thirdly,
that the company’s internal authorisation constituted the relevant employee a delegee (as
opposed to an agent), it is plain that once a ""person managing the business of a fund"" is a
company - which cannot act other than through duly empowered officers or employees - then
such manager’s authority to delegate is necessarily implied. Once that is so, there is no warrant,
especially in the case of a large company, to confine the delegated power to those of senior rank.
(No attack was made in the papers on the competence or efficiency of the employee concerned.)
It follows that the Court a quo was right.
As to costs, the respondents on appeal were represented by two counsel and in the heads of
argument on their behalf the costs occasioned by such employment were requested.
Significantly, only one counsel represented them in the court below and only one counsel
represented the trustees at all stages. Considering the nature of the legal question involved in the
main issue on appeal I am not disposed to think that this is a case in which an order for the costs
of two counsel is appropriate.
The appeal is dismissed with costs.

In the matter between :

GRAHAM JOHN BURSEY

Appellant
and
JANE NOELLE BURSEY

First Respondent
THE SHERIFF OF THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA (SOUTH EASTERN
CAPE LOCAL DIVISION)

Second Respondent

Coram: Vivier, Nienaber, Howie, Olivier et Plewman JJA.
Heard: 19 March 1999
Delivered: 30 March 1999

Divorce - maintenance for child until self-supporting - effect of order

J U D G M E N T

VIVIER JA:

The appellant and the first respondent were divorced on 17 October 1994. The divorce order
incorporated an agreement between them which provided for custody of their two minor
children, John and Kevin, to be awarded to the first respondent and for maintenance for the
children to be paid by the appellant (the defendant) as follows (clause 2) :

""The defendant shall pay to the plaintiff, as and for maintenance for the said minor
children, the sum of R750 per month per child, the first payment to be made on the
last day of the month in which a final decree of divorce may be granted by the above
Honourable Court and thereafter on the last day of each succeeding month. The said
maintenance shall be paid until the said children become self-supporting.""

At the time of the divorce the elder son, John, was 19 years and 7 months old, having been
born on 6 March 1975. He was a first year student at Rhodes University, Grahamstown and
had registered for a three-year course which he would ordinarily have completed by the end
of 1996. On 21 February 1996 the appellant, who practises as an advocate in Port Elizabeth,
wrote to John informing him that when he turned 21 years of age on 6 March 1996 he would
no longer be obliged to pay maintenance for him through his mother as she would no longer
be his custodian. He told him that from that day he would pay maintenance directly to him
and requested details of his expenses, his part-time earnings and the amounts received from
his mother in order to calculate the future maintenance. John=s attorney subsequently
furnished the appellant with a list of his expenses. On 29 April 1996 the appellant wrote to
John complaining that he had not been furnished with details of John=s part time earnings nor
the amounts he had received from his mother. The appellant went on to state that in view of
John=s attitude he had decided not to assist him any further and that the matter would have to
be resolved in court. The appellant had in an earlier letter advised John to approach the

maintenance court for maintenance. No further maintenance for John was thereafter paid by
the appellant. This resulted in the first respondent, who had in the meantime moved to Cape
Town, issuing a summons out of the small claims court at Cape Town on 21 June 1996 for
arrear maintenance for John in terms of the divorce order and John causing the appellant to
be summoned to appear before the maintenance court at Grahamstown on 29 July 1996. This
hearing was postponed to 28 October 1996 when the matter was withdrawn. The action in the
small claim=s court was withdrawn on the day of the hearing i e on 24 October 1996. On 1
October 1996, and while the proceedings in the small claims and maintenance courts were
still pending, the first respondent caused a writ of execution in terms of rule 45 (1) of the
Uniform Rules of Court to be issued out of the Eastern Cape Division, pursuant to which
certain of the appellant=s law reports were attached by the deputy sheriff, Port Elizabeth on 9
October 1996. After the first respondent had refused the appellant=s request to withdraw the
writ he applied in the Eastern Cape Division for an order setting aside the writ. The deputy
sheriff, Port Elizabeth, was cited as the second respondent but he filed a notice abiding the
court=s decision and has taken no further part in the proceedings. The application was granted
by Erasmus J whose judgment is reported as B v B and Another 1997 (4) SA 1018
(SECLD). The first respondent=s appeal to the Full Court succeeded and with the necessary
leave the appellant now appeals to this Court. The first respondent has filed a notice abiding
our decision and was not represented at the hearing before us.

According to our common law both divorced parents have a duty to maintain a child of the
dissolved marriage. The incidence of this duty in respect of each parent depends upon their
relative means and circumstances and the needs of the child from time to time. The duty does
not terminate when the child reaches a particular age but continues after majority. (In re
Estate Visser 1948 (3) SA 1129 (C) at 1133-4; Kemp v Kemp 1958 (3) SA 736 (D & CLD) at
737 in fine; Lamb v Sack 1974(2) SA 670 (T); Hoffmann v Van Herdan NO and Another
1982 (2) SA 274 (T) at 275A.) That the duty to maintain extends beyond majority is
recognized by sec 6 of the Divorce Act 70 of 1979. Sec 6 (1) (a) provides that a decree of
divorce shall not be granted until the court is satisfied that the provisions made or
contemplated with regard to the welfare of any minor or dependent child of the marriage are
satisfactory or are the best that can be effected in the circumstances. Sec 6 (3) provides that a
court granting a decree of divorce may make any order which it deems fit in regard to the
maintenance of a dependent child of the marriage. This provision must be contrasted with the
provision in the sub-section relating to the custody or guardianship of, or access to a minor
child. A maintenance order does not replace or alter a divorced parent=s common law duty to
maintain a child. In Kemp v Kemp, supra, Jansen J stated at 738 A-B that as a matter of
expediency the court, as the upper guardian of the child, usually regulates the incidence of
this duty as between the parents when it grants the divorce and that its order for maintenance
is ancillary to the common law duty to support.

In the present case the divorce order stipulates periodic payments of a fixed sum of money
""until the said children become self-supporting"". In neither of the courts below was it
contended that both John and Kevin had to be self-supporting before the duty to pay
maintenance for John ceased.

The contention on behalf of the appellant was that on a proper interpretation of the order
John=s maintenance ceased when he attained majority. Reliance for this submission was
placed on cases such as Richter v Richter 1947 (3) SA 786 (W), Kemp=s case and Gold v
Gold 1975 (4) SA 237 (D & CLD).

Relying on the judgment of Price J in Richter=s case (at 91) it was submitted that the words
""the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff, as and for maintenance for the said minor children
..."" in clause 2 qualified the duration of the order i e that the duty to maintain ceased upon
majority. I cannot agree. Clause 1 of the agreement awards the custody of ""the minor
children, John Stuart Bursey and Kevin George Bursey"" to the first respondent. The words
""the said minor children"" in clause 2 merely identify the children by reference and cannot
have been intended to qualify the duration of the order, particularly in view of the express
term as to the duration of the duty to maintain which follow.

It was next submitted, also on the strength of Richter=s case, that John=s maintenance in terms
of the order was payable to the first respondent in her capacity as his custodian so that when
this status terminated upon majority the appellant=s obligation to pay her either ceased or was
henceforth enforceable only by John and not by the first respondent. The maintenance order
is, as I have said, ancillary to the common law duty of support and merely regulates the
incidence of this duty as between the parents. The effect of this order is simply that after
John=s majority the maintenance payable to him by his parents would continue to be paid to
him by the first respondent who would recover under the Court=s order the appellant=s
contribution to this common parental duty to support. This she was fully entitled to do in
terms of the order. John=s position was not affected as he could at any time during the
operation of the order have enforced his common law right to an upward variation of the
maintenance payable by his parents upon proof of the requisites for such a variation. I cannot,
therefore, agree with the submission that the mere fact that John=s maintenance was payable
to the first respondent meant that the maintenance ceased upon his majority.

In the court of first instance Erasmus J said (at 1020 E-F of the report) that as a general rule
an order to pay maintenance for a minor child to a custodian parent loses its effect when the
child attains majority. As authority for this proposition the learned judge relied upon the
decisions in the Richter, Kemp and Gold cases. None of these cases, however, affords
authority for a statement of the law so wide in its terms. The Full Court correctly pointed this
out. In the Richter and Gold cases the maintenance orders fixed no time when the payment of
maintenance should cease but simply provided for monthly payments of certain sums and
nothing more. In these cases it was said that there was an implication in the order that the
payment of maintenance was to cease when the child reached the age of majority or earlier if
he or she became self-supporting (Richter=s case at 91 and Gold=s case at 239 D). In these
cases it was necessary, so it was held, to imply a condition into the order so that proper effect
could be given to it. It is not necessary for a decision of the present case to decide the
correctness of the decisions in the Richter and Gold cases. The wording of the order in the
present case is quite different and it is not necessary to imply a condition in order to interpret
it (cf Russell v Boughton 1955 (2) SA 229 (SR)). In Kemp=s case the maintenance order
provided for the monthly payment of a fixed sum of money until the minor reached the age of
18 years. The non-custodian parent successfully applied for a variation of the order before the
child reached the age of 18 years in view of the fact that she was earning a monthly income in
excess of the amount of maintenance payable. The order was amended to add the proviso that
in the event of the child earning more than the amount stated at any time before reaching the
age of 18 years, maintenance for her would not be payable and should she earn less the
maintenance would be reduced pro tanto. In his judgment (at 738 F-G) Jansen J referred to
Richter=s case and the implication which was said to arise in that case and stated that it would
be undesirable to extend this approach to the case before him. Jansen J went on to hold (at

738 in fine) that if the order stipulates periodic payment of a fixed sum of money until the
minor reaches a certain age there should be no room for an implication that the order will
ipso jure cease to operate before that time if the minor becomes self-supporting. Kemp=s case
is therefore no authority for the general rule stated by Erasmus J.

In the present case the order is clear and unambiguous and there is no room for the
implication found in the Richter and Gold cases. In my view the order means precisely what
it says, namely, that the appellant is obliged to pay maintenance for John until he becomes
self-supporting, even if that occurs after he has attained majority. As I have indicated above,
there is no reason in law why a divorce order may not provide for maintenance beyond
majority in proper circumstances. An example of such a case is Raff v Cohen 1956 (4) SA
426 (C). The consent paper which was incorporated in the court=s order provided for the
non-custodian parent to pay maintenance for the two minor children in a certain sum per
month ""until both children shall have married"". The non-custodian parent subsequently
applied for an order declaring that the order meant that the maintenance would be payable
until both children reached majority. In dismissing the application Newton Thompson J,
referring to the terms of the consent paper, said (at 428 E-G):

""I can hardly imagine words which are clearer than that, and I see no reason whatever
why I should insert a term that that payment of maintenance was to terminate when
the unmarried girl became 21. It is just the sort of provision I can imagine parents
making to safeguard their daughters. They might well consider that their obligation to
the
daughter went on to the time of her marriage even if that was after she turned 21.""

Although not raised on appellant=s behalf it is desirable to consider the question whether the
order automatically ceases to operate when John becomes self-supporting. As explained in
Kemp=s case at 738 E-G, depending on the terms of the order, a maintenance order exists
separately from the fluctuations of the incidence of the common law duty to maintain but
may be brought into harmony with that duty by the court at any time. The order is thus not
ipso jure varied by changed circumstances but remains fully effective until terminated or
varied by the court. The order itself may, however, stipulate a period for its operation eg until
the child reaches a certain age and it will cease to operate at that stage (Kemp=s case at 738
E-G).

In my view the present order fixed a time for its duration i e until John becomes
self-supporting and it will cease to operate when that event occurs (or conceivably when John
becomes capable of supporting himself, a matter which I need not decide). Whether that
event has indeed occurred may be the subject of dispute but it is an objective fact capable of
being established with sufficient certainty.

Notwithstanding the continued existence of an order to pay maintenance it will of course
always be open to the parent or other party liable to pay it to raise the defence on the facts
that he is no longer so liable, either in whole or in part, e g because the child has become
self-supporting. I should point out that such a defence was at no stage raised in these
proceedings.

It was submitted that the agreement which was incorporated in the court=s order constituted a
stipulatio alteri in favour of John with the result that only John had the right to enforce the

obligation to pay maintenance. I do not agree that the agreement was a stipulatio alteri. In
concluding the agreement the appellant and the first respondent had no intention of
conferring a right upon John which, upon acceptance by or on his behalf, would be a
contractual right, a right other than that flowing from their common law duty to maintain
John (Kemp=s case at 741 F-G and Total South Africa (Pty) Ltd v Bekker No 1992 (1) SA 617
(A) at 625 D-H).

A submission in the heads of argument filed on behalf of the appellant that either the Court of
first instance or the Full Court should in the exercise of a discretion contended for have
granted an order staying or setting aside the writ of execution, was abandoned at the hearing
before us. Nothing further need therefore be said about it.

For the reasons given the appeal is dismissed with costs.

GELEWER : 30 Maart 1999
Aksie van afhanklikes - geskeide vrou met ’n bevel tot onderhoud in haar guns - gewese man
gedood - aksie in beginsel erken.
UITSPRAAK
NIENABER AR:
[1] Waar ’n broodwinner op nalatige wyse gedood word, het sy afhanklikes ’n aksie
teen die persoon wat sy dood veroorsaak het (Boberg, The Law of Persons and the Family,
302-3). Is die afhanklike ’n weduwee, is daar regtens nie ’n probleem nie. Maar wat nou as sy
van haar man geskei is en ingevolge art 7(2) van die Wet op Egskeiding, 70 van 1979,
kragtens ’n hofbevel op ’n bepaalde bedrag aan onderhoud geregtig was? Is sy dan teenoor die
dader (of teenoor die derdeparty-versekeraar indien sy dood deur die nalatige bestuur van ’n
motorvoertuig veroorsaak is) op skadevergoeding geregtig? Dit is die primêre vraag. En wat
as sy en die broodwinner na die egskeiding steeds as man en vrou saamgeleef het en hy haar,
ten tyde van sy dood, ten volle onderhou het? Is sy dan, ondanks die bestaande
onderhoudsbevel, as ’n party tot ’n sogenaamde ""gebruiklike verbinding"" op skadevergoeding
geregtig selfs al oorskry dit die bedrag van die onderhoudsbevel? Dit is die tweede vraag. En
wat nou as die [2] partye, na die egskeiding, ’n formele skikkingsooreenkoms aangegaan het
waarin hy onderneem om haar ten volle te onderhou en sy instem om, solank as wat die partye
saamwoon, nie op nakoming van die hofbevel aan te dring nie? Het sy dan, afgesien van die
bestaan van die onderhoudsbevel en bloot op grond van die inmenging met haar kontraktuele
reg op onderhoud, ’n eis teen die derdeparty- versekeraar? Dit is die derde vraag. Al drie
hierdie vrae, wat as alternatiewe eise ingeklee is, het in ’n aksie in die Transvaalse Provinsiale
Afdeling ter sprake gekom waarin die respondent as eiseres skadevergoeding gevorder het van
die appellant as die derdeparty-versekeraar van ’n voertuig wat op ’n nalatige wyse bestuur is
as gevolg waarvan die eiseres se gewese man sy lewe verloor het. In ’n gestelde saak
ooreenkomstig hofreël 33(4) beantwoord Du Plessis R die eerste vraag bevestigend en die

tweede en derde ontkennend. Met verlof van die hof a quo dien al drie vrae tans voor hierdie
hof, die eerste by wyse van ’n appèl, die tweede en derde by wyse van ’n kruis-appèl.
[3] Die eiseres is op 22 Januarie 1983 binne gemeenskap van goed met haar man, na wie ek
voortaan as die oorledene verwys, getroud. Twee kinders is uit die huwelik gebore.
Op 20 September 1991 is hulle geskei. Ingevolge die hofbevel wat kragtens art 7(2) van die
Wet op Egskeiding, 70 van 1979, verleen is, was die eiseres op onderhoud vir haarself teen ’n
koers van R1000 per maand geregtig. (Onderhoud vir die kinders is op R800 per maand per
kind bepaal.)
Op 2 Oktober 1991, twaalf dae na die egskeiding, gaan die eiseres en die oorledene ’n
skriftelike ooreenkoms aan wat vir die verdeling van hul gemeenskaplike boedel voorsiening
maak en wat voorts bepaal dat die onderhoudsbevel opgeskort word vir solank as wat die
eiseres en die kinders in die gemeenskaplike woning te Flamboyantstraat 24, Witkoppies,
Klerksdorp, bly woon.
Vir doeleindes van die gestelde saak is aanvaar dat die eiseres en die [4] oorledene na die
egskeiding ooreengekom het dat hulle
""ongeag die egskeidingsbevel ... en sonder onderbreking in tydsverloop ... hul
huweliksverhouding en gemeenskaplike huishouding voortgesit en ten minste in die
vorm van ’n Gebruiklike Verbinding as man en vrou saamgeleef het tot en met die
Oorledene se dood, en die Eiseres en die Oorledene voortgegaan om mekaar as
eggenote te ondersteun, te voldoen aan hulle pligte as eggenote en om hul pligte met
betrekking tot die gemeenskaplike huishouding na te kom, en die Oorledene
voortgegaan om die Eiseres en die minderjariges tot die dag van sy dood te onderhou
en te versorg ooreenkomstig dieselfde lewenstandaard as voor die datum van
egskeiding, tot so ’n mate dat sy onderhoud aan en versorging van die Eiseres en die
minderjariges sy verpligtinge kragtens die egskeidingsbevel te bowe gegaan het.""
Die ooreengekome feite meld egter nie dat die eiseres en die kinders by die gegewe adres bly
woon het nie.
Amper ’n jaar later, op 6 Oktober 1992, is die oorledene in ’n motorbotsing oorlede. Die
botsing was te wyte aan die nalatigheid van die bestuurder van die versekerde voertuig.
Die verweerder was ’n ""benoemde agent"" vir doeleindes van die destyds [5] geldende
Multilaterale Motorvoertuigongelukkefondswet, 93 van 1989 wat as sodanig kragtens a 40
van die Ooreenkoms (soos omskryf)
""verplig [was] om enigeen wie ook al (in hierdie Ooreenkoms die derde partye
genoem) te vergoed vir verlies of skade wat die derde party gely het as gevolg van -
a) ...
b) die dood of liggaamlike besering van iemand anders, wat .... veroorsaak is
deur of voortvloei uit die bestuur van ’n motorvoertuig ... indien die ... dood te
wyte is aan die nalatigheid of ... van die persoon wat die motorvoertuig bestuur
het ...""

Ingevolge a 48(a) is die benoemde agent egter
"" ... nie verplig om iemand ... vir enige verlies of skade te vergoed nie -
a) waarvoor nòg die bestuurder nòg die eienaar van die betrokke
motorvoertuig aanspreeklik sou gewees het indien Hoofstuk XVI nie by hierdie
Ooreenkoms ingesluit was nie.""
Die pertinente regsvraag is dus of die bestuurder, was dit nie vir die bepalings van die Wet nie,
teenoor die eiseres aanspreeklik sou wees omdat hy vir die dood van haar gewese man wat
kragtens ’n hofbevel onderhoud aan haar [6] verskuldig was, verantwoordelik was.
Die kinders se eis teen die appellant is geskik; die eiseres s'n nie. Ingevolge die gestelde saak
staan die kwantum van die eis vir latere beslegting oor.
Die aanloop tot die aksie wat hedendaags vir bepaalde afhanklikes beskikbaar is om teen die
dader op te tree wat die dood van hul broodwinner veroorsaak het, is meermale al beskryf en
is vir huidige doeleindes nie omstrede nie. Daar kan volstaan word met die opsomming in 8
LAWSA (Eerste her-uitgawe) par 11:
""The action of dependants for the recovery of loss suffered as a result of the
wrongful killing of their breadwinner was unknown to Roman law. An action
for the recovery of compensation for loss occasioned by the wrongful killing of
a breadwinner was, however, available to the dependants in Roman-Dutch law.
The exact origins of the action are uncertain. It probably evolved under the
influence of the indigenous Germanic law concerning the institution of
zoengeld and the concepts of natural law as formulated by medieval and
sixteenth century theologians.""
[7] Presies wat die ontstaansbron van die onderhoudsplig was en watter afhanklikes volgens
die ou skrywers daarby betrek is, is kwessies waaroor daar nie volkome duidelikheid bestaan
nie.
In sy De Jure Belli ac Pacis (2.17.13) skryf De Groot dat die aksie toekom:
""... iis quos occisus alere ex officio solebat, puta parentibus uxoribus liberis ...""
(wat deur Feenstra, 1972 Acta Juridica 234 vertaal is as
""... those whom the deceased was accustomed to aliment ex officio, for example his
parents, his widow, his children ..."")
In sy Inleidinge (3.33.2) meld De Groot weer dat die aksie toekom aan
""... de weduwe, kinderen, oock anderen zoo daer eenighen zijn, die door des
nedergeslagens arbeid plagen onderhouden te werden. ...""
Of die woorde ""oock anderen zoo daer eenighen zijn"" op die ""ouers"" slaan na wie hy in De
Jure Belli ac Pacis verwys het, dan wel of dit op ander bloedverwante betrekking het of selfs
op iemand wat bloot feitelik deur die broodwinner [8] onderhou is, kan nie met sekerheid

bepaal word nie. Waarskynlik het hy, benewens huweliksgenote, naaste aanverwante in
gedagte want in die Inleidinge 3.33.3. praat hy weer van
"" ... oock de weduwe, weduwenaer, kinderen ende by ghebreecke van dien andere
naeste maghen, de klachte moghen doen.""
En later van:
""... echtgenoten, kinderen ofte maghen van den overleden""
wat op ’n noue familieverwantskap dui.
Dieselfde soort onduidelikheid tref mens ook by die latere skrywers aan na wie Davel,
Skadevergoeding aan Afhanklikes, 38 en volgende verwys. So byvoorbeeld noem Voet 9.2.11
""uxori liberisque fuis aut aliis propinquis"" (""wife, children or other close relatives"") asook
""uxori, liberis, similibusque"" (dit wil sê, ""wife, children and the like"" (Gane se vertaling)).
Uit frases soos ""oock anderen zoo daer enighen zijn"" van De Groot en ""and [9] the like"" van
Voet kan kwalik ’n beginsel afgelei word. Die frase word nie toegevoeg by ’n register van ál
die erkende lede van die klas nie. Die moontlikheid bly dus bestaan dat dit ook betrekking kan
hê op ontbrekende lede van die klas. Gevolglik is dit onmoontlik om tot ’n vaste
gevolgtrekking te kom of die ou skrywers slegs huweliks- en bloedverwante bedoel het, en
indien wel, of daar onder die bloedverwante ’n numerus clausus was (vgl Davel aw, 46).
In Union Government (Minister of Railways & Harbours) v Warneke 1911 AD 657 word daar
nietemin wel, na aanleiding van die ou skrywers, van ’n beginsel gepraat. Daar het dit gegaan
oor die eis van ’n wewenaar vir die skade wat hy as gevolg van die dood van sy gade gely het.
Met verwysing na Voet 9.2.11 verklaar Lord De Villiers op 663:
""It would be no undue extension of this right to hold that, where a wife during her
lifetime actively assisted her husband in the support and education of their children, he
would be entitled, upon her being killed through negligence, to claim such pecuniary
damages as he can be proved to have sustained by reason of the permanent loss of such
[10] assistance.""
Innes R verklaar op 664-5 weer soos volg:
""The books agree, in confining the remedy to certain relatives dependent on the
deceased for support. A wife whose husband has been killed is universally recognised
as being entitled to claim it, yet strange to say there is no express authority for the
existence of a corresponding right in a husband. Among the many commentators who
discuss the question, some in considerable detail, there is not one who states that an
action of this nature is competent to a widower. The omission is highly significant; but
in the absence of express authority the other way, one would not be justified in
regarding it as decisive. Recognising, as I think we must, that it never occurred to the
jurists of the seventeenth century to extend this remedy to a husband, and that there is
no reported decision so extending it, we are still at liberty to inquire whether there is
any reason why we should not make it available now. The position of our law with
regard to negligence to-day is the result of the growth and the regulated expansion of
the original provisions of the Lex Aquilia. Crude and archaic in some respects, their
operation was gradually widened by the application of the utilis actio, and by the
interpretation of the Roman jurists. The broadening process was continued by Dutch

lawyers on the same lines; and there is no reason why our Courts should not similarly
adapt the doctrine and reasoning of the law to the conditions of modern life, so far as
that can be done without doing violence to its principles.""
[11] Of mens hier werklik met ’n uitbreiding van die aksie te doen het (vgl De Groot Inleidin
ge 3.33.3 en Matthaeus II 48, 5, 7, 11), is vir huidige doeleindes nie ter sake nie; wat eerder
van belang is, is dat die hof dit as ’n uitbreiding met die oog op die eise van die moderne
samelewing ingesien het en bereid was om die kategorie van afhanklikes aan wie ’n aksie
verleen word, daarvolgens aan te pas (vgl Ongevallekommissaris v Santam Bpk 1999 (1) SA
251 (A) 258E-H).Die beginsel waarna in Warneke se saak verwys word, word op 661 so
geformuleer:
""With regard to the particular form of utilis actio of which the plaintiff desires to avail
himself, the authorities allowed it only to near relatives who were dependent in whole
or in part on the deceased for support. And they give full effect to the principles
regulating claims for damage under the Lex Aquilia, because the only cases in which
they recognise the action are cases in which the deceased was under an obligation to
support the claimant. They do not as a rule make special reference to this obligation,
because the relationship of the parties imports it. For they deal in terms only with the
claims of the wife, children or parents, to all of whom of course the deceased owed a
legal duty. Yet some of them make special reference to the existence of this duty.
Matthaeus (De Crim. 48, 5, 11) says that the action is competent to the spouse, the
children and others whom the deceased man was bound to support. And Vinnius (Inst.
4, 3, 1) gives it to those whom the deceased was wont ex officio to maintain. So that
in all the cases actually mentioned in the books, the right of the claimant to demand
assistance was a right of property, the deprivation of which by the culpa of the
defendant would quite naturally found a claim for patrimonial damages. I can find no
authority for the proposition that the law of Holland would have given an action of this
nature to any relation not damnified by being deprived of benefits supplied by the
deceased under a legal duty to do so. I do not think that we should depart from the
principles to which I have drawn attention, and it only remains to consider whether
consistently with their observance the statements in the declaration make out a case for
relief"".
Hoe die beginsel ook al geformuleer word, die geval van die geskeide vrou kan nie daaronder
tuisgebring word nie. Gemeenregtelik het sy, na ontbinding van die huwelik, geen aanspraak
op onderhoud teen haar gewese man gehad nie. So ’n aanspraak het trouens eers in 1953 in
Suid-Afrika ontstaan met die aanvaarding van die Wet op Huweliksaangeleenthede, 37 van
1953.
’n Aksie soos die onderhawige, waar ’n geskeide vrou met ’n hofbevel tot [13] onderhoud in
haar guns teen die dader optree wat vir haar gewese man se dood verantwoordelik is, kan na
my mening dus nie op grond van die geskrifte van die ou skrywers geregverdig word nie.
En dit is presies wat in Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Trust en Assuransiemaatskappy v Fondo
1960 (2) SA 467 (A) ook gesê is. Die Fondo-saak was nie gemoeid met die lot van die
geskeide vrou nie, maar begaan oor die sogenaamde ""naturelle-weduwee"" wie se man op
nalatige wyse gedood is. Die hof bevind dat so iemand wat in ’n gebruiklike verbinding
volgens naturellereg en -gebruik as man en vrou saamgeleef het, nie ’n afhanklike vir
doeleindes van die gemeenregtelike aksie aan afhanklikes was nie. Botha Wnd AR verklaar op

471E-F:
""Die regsmiddel wat deur die respondent aangewend word, is die actio sui generis wat
ons reg aan die afhanklikes van ’n oorledene verleen om op hul eie naam en uit eie reg
vergoeding van die vermoënskade, d.w.s. die verlies van onderhoud, wat die dood
hulle veroorsaak het, op die wandader te verhaal.""
[14] Die ratio van die beslissings is myns insiens te vind in die volgende dictum op 472G-H:
""Dit is duidelik uit die boeke sowel as die doel van die regsmiddel dat dit beperk was
tot persone wat vir hul onderhoud van die arbeid van die oorledene afhanklik was, en
aangesien volgens die Romeins-Hollandse Reg niemand verplig was om ’n ander buite
sy familiekring te onderhou nie, en gesien die waarskynlike oorsprong daarvan in die
gebruik van soengeld, volg dit myns insiens uit die aanhalings hierbo dat die
regsmiddel nooit anders as beperk was nie tot die vrou en daardie familielede van die
oorledene wat hy verplig was om te onderhou en daadwerklik onderhou het.""
Ter illustrasie word dan op 472H-473A gesê:
""Indien ’n reg op onderhoud deur die oorledene die enigste voorwaarde vir die
aanwending van die regsmiddel vir die verhaal van vermoënskade as gevolg van die
dood was, sou die aanname van iedere wetsbepaling wat iemand onder ’n verpligting
stel om aan ’n ander onderhoud te betaal, ’n uitbreiding van die regsmiddel meebring.
So sou, byvoorbeeld, ’n bevel tot onderhoud kragtens art. 10 van Wet 37 van 1953 ten
gunste van ’n vrou wat van haar man geskei is, ’n uitbreiding van die regsmiddel
meebring tot die vrou om by die dood van haar gewese man skadevergoeding te
vorder. Dit is myns insiens uit die aard en doel van die regsmiddel duidelik dat dit vir
so ’n uitbreiding nie vatbaar is nie.""
[15] Hierdie illustrasie dek presies die geval wat tans onder bespreking is. Vir die beslissing in
Fondo was die stelling egter nie essensieel nie en myns insiens was dit klaarblyklik obiter. Die
uitspraak vervolg:
""Die vraag of die respondent die regsmiddel tot verhaal van haar vermoënskade wat sy
gely het as gevolg van die dood van haar man, kan aanwend, hang dus af nie slegs van
die vraag of die oorledene teenoor haar onder ’n regsverpligting gestaan het om haar
gedurende die bestaan van die gebruiklike verbinding te onderhou en daadwerklik
onderhou het nie, maar ook of sy volgens die gemenereg, wat die enigste regstelsel is
wat by ’n in die Hooggeregshof ingestelde geding toegepas kan word, daarop kan
staatmaak dat sy die vrou van die oorledene was volgens ’n huwelik wat
ooreenkomstig die gemenereg as ’n wettige huwelik erken word, want slegs so ’n
huwelik kan aan haar die status van ’n getroude vrou in ons reg verleen"" (op 473C-D).
En aangesien ’n gebruiklike verbinding nie ’n huwelik was wat ooreenkomstig die gemenereg
as ’n wettige huwelik erken is nie, word die eis afgewys.
Die Fondo-beslissing is deur akademici aan skerp kritiek onderwerp (vgl Boberg, The Law of
Delict, 728; Van der Merwe en Olivier, Die Onregmatige Daad in die Suid-Afrikaanse Reg,
6de uitg 344 en volgende; Neethling, Potgieter en Visser, Deliktereg 277-8; Davel, aw, 49 en

volgende) en ook nie deur die Zimbabwiese hof gevolg nie (Chawanda v Zimnat Insurance Co
Ltd 1990 (1) SA 1019 (ZH); Zimnat Insurance Co Ltd v Chawanda 1991 (2) SA 825 (ZS)).
Tans gaan dit nie soseer oor die korrektheid van die Fondo-beslissing as sodanig nie maar oor
die juistheid van die obiter dictum, hierbo aangehaal, wat die geskeide vrou ondanks die reg
op onderhoud wat sy aan die hofbevel ontleen ’n aksie teen die dader sou ontsê. In effek
beteken die obiter dictum dat haar eis om vergoeding, waar haar onderhoud vanweë die dood
van haar gewese man in gedrang kom, regtens nie erken word nie; anders gestel, dat haar
onbetwiste reg op onderhoud, anders as dié van ander afhanklikes, regtens nie teen sodanige
optrede as beskermingswaardig geag word en dat die optrede van die dader dus nie teenoor
haar as onregmatig beskou word nie.
Die dictum raak die aksie wat die gemenereg aan sekere afhanklikes verleen. [17] Dat so ’n
aksie, soos dit in ons reg ontplooi het, in ’n sin anomalies van aard is, word deur die moderne
skrywers sterk beklemtoon (vgl die vroeëre verwysings) en is lank reeds deur hierdie hof
toegegee. Vandaar dat dit as sui generis bestempel is. Aldus is in Legal Insurance Co Ltd v
Botes 1963 (1) SA 608 (A) op 614D gesê:
""The remedy has continued its evolution in South Africa - particularly during the
course of this century - through judicial pronouncements, including judgments of this
Court, and it has kept abreast of the times in regard to such matters as benefits from
insurance policies. The remedy relates to material loss ""caused to the dependants of the
deceased man by his death"". It aims at placing them in as good a position, as regards
maintenance, as they would have been in if the deceased had not been killed. To this
end, material losses as well as benefits and prospects must be considered. The remedy
has been described as anomalous, peculiar, and sui generis - but it is effective.""
En in Evins v Shield Insurance Co Ltd 1980 (2) SA 814 (A) op 837H tot 838A is verklaar:
""An essential and unusual feature of the remedy is that, while the defendant incurs
liability because he has acted wrongfully and negligently (or with dolus) towards the
deceased and thereby caused the death of the deceased, the claimant (the dependant)
derives his right of action not through the deceased or from his estate but from the
facts that he has been injured by the death of the deceased and that the defendant is in
law responsible therefor. Only a dependant to whom the deceased was under a legal
duty to provide maintenance and support may sue and in such action the dependant
must establish actual patrimonial loss, accrued and prospective, as a consequence of
the death of the breadwinner.""
Die anomalieë waarna verwys word, is tipies van die aksie van die afhanklikes as sodanig en is
nie eie aan die geval van die geskeide vrou wat ’n hofbevel tot onderhoud in haar guns het nie.
Die betoog van die appellant dat dié soort aksie wat haar betref derhalwe eerder beperk as
uitgebrei moet word, gaan dus nie op nie. Of daar, om die onthalwe van regselegansie en
toekomstige regsontwikkeling, ’n noodsaak bestaan om die erkende anomalieë uit ons
regspraak te weer, en wat die praktiese implikasies daarvan in ’n gegewe geval sou wees, is
kwessies waaroor daar in hierdie saak nie na behore betoog is nie en wat gevolglik nie beslis
hoef te word nie. Die enigste vraag wat tans ter sprake is, is of die klas van afhanklikes
uitgebrei behoort te word om ook die geval van die geskeide vrou met ’n hofbevel in haar
guns daarby te betrek. Die geleentheid om opnuut oor die dogmatiese kwelvrae te besin, sal te

pas kom wanneer die uitslag van ’n geding pertinent daarvan afhang - wat hier nie die geval is
nie.
Die verlies aan onderhoud wat ’n afhanklike ondervind wanneer die broodwinner gedood
word, word allerweë as ’n verskyningsvorm van sogenaamde suiwer ekonomiese verlies erken
(vgl Boberg, aw 104, 123, 499; 8 LAWSA Deel I (Eerste her-uitgawe) par 62), dit wil sê,
waar die skade nie-fisies van aard is (vgl Burchell, Principles of Delict, 47; Neethling,
Potgieter en Visser, aw 286).
Dat daar sedert die vroeë sestigerjare, toe Fondo beslis is, ’n enorme ontwikkeling op die
gebied van die erkenning van instansies van eise om suiwer ekonomiese verlies plaasgevind
het, weliswaar in situasies waar ’n omskrewe reg makeer, is oorbekend. Die ontwikkeling
word in al die bekende handboeke oor die deliktereg beskryf. In Neethling, Potgieter en Visser
aw 288, om maar een te noem, word dit soos volg saamgevat:
""Die maatstaf wat by hierdie beoordeling aangewend moet word, is die algemene
redelikheids- of boni mores-onregmatigheidskriterium. Soos bekend, vereis dié
kriterium dat die hof ""a value judgement embracing all relevant facts and involving
considerations of policy"" moet uitspreek. Dit word gewoonlik beskryf as die
""policy-based aspect of the 'duty of care' concept, by means of which the scope of
delictual liability is judicially controlled"". Die boni mores -kriterium behels basies ’n
noukeurige afweging van die belange van die betrokke partye met inagneming van die
gemeenskapsbelang.""
Word hierdie benadering en gedagterigting op die onderhawige geval toegepas, waar die
Fondo-dictum ’n leemte geskep het, is daar in my gemoed weinig twyfel dat die
gemeenskapsbelang verg dat ’n geskeide vrou se aanspraak op onderhoud, net soos dié van
enige ander afhanklike, beskermingswaardig is. Logies, regspolities en op billikheidsgronde
bestaan daar na my mening geen rede om die geval van die geskeide vrou van dié van ander
afhanklikes te onderskei nie; dat die bron van die reg in die een geval gemeenregtelik en in die
ander statutêr is, kom nie daarop aan nie - trouens, die statutêre verlening van die reg op
onderhoud aan die geskeide vrou is op sigself die produk van langdurige regsontwikkeling
gegrond op die gemeenskapsoortuiging van wat reg en billik is. Die onderhoud post huwelik is
in ’n sin bloot die voortsetting van die man se onderhoudsplig stante matrimonio. Akademiese
skrywers begunstig omtrent almal die verlening van so ’n aksie. En die vrees wat soms om
regspolitiese redes teen die toestaan van ’n aksie om suiwer ekonomiese verlies uitgespreek
word (""liability in an indeterminate amount, for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate
class: Ultra Mares Corporation v Toche (1931) 255 NY 170, aangehaal deur Burchell aw 47),
geld nie hier nie.
Na my mening bestaan daar dus geen gegronde rede om iemand in die eiseres se posisie in
beginsel’n aksie om skadevergoeding te ontsê nie.
Namens die appellant is egter betoog dat daar sekere addisionele anomalieë bestaan wat aan
die eis van die geskeide vrou eie is. Wat in die besonder [22] beklemtoon is, is dat haar eis,
anders as dié van ander afhanklikes, gegrond is op ’n hofbevel wat ’n spesifieke bedrag
vermeld, sodat die omvang van haar eis aan die hand van daardie bedrag bepaal word en nie
aan die hand van haar daadwerklike behoeftes nie. Die argument oortuig nie. Solank as wat
daar ’n onderhoudsplig uit hoofde van ’n hofbevel bestaan, soos hier die geval is, sal die

bedrag in die hofbevel stellig die eerste faktor wees by die bepaling van die bedrag wat
uiteindelik aan ’n eiseres in so ’n geval toegeken word, maar dit is nie die enigste of selfs ’n
deurslaggewende faktor nie. Die feitelike vraag bly telkens watter bedrag die eiseres by wyse
van onderhoud van haar gewese man sou ontvang het. Daardie bedrag verg, soos elke geval
waar dié tipe eis gekwantifiseer moet word, ’n veelvoud van oorwegings en vooruitskouings
(vgl Boberg, The Law of Persons and the Family 304-5; Ongevallekommissaris v Santam Bpk
1999 (1) SA 251 (A) 258E-H). Na my oordeel steek daar in hierdie aspek niks anomalies nie.
[23] ’n Verdere argument, gegrond op die bepalings van die Wet op Onderhoud van
Langslewende Gades, Wet 27 van 1990, is myns insiens ewe onoortuigend. Die Wet bepaal
dat indien ’n huwelik deur dood ontbind word die langslewende ’n vordering teen die boedel
van die afgestorwe gade het vir die voorsiening in sy of haar redelike onderhoudsbehoeftes tot
by sy of haar dood of hertroue vir sover hy of sy nie uit eie middele en verdienste daartoe in
staat is nie. Omdat die Wetgewer beskerming verleen aan die gade, en nie aan die gewese gade
nie, is dit ’n aanduiding, so is betoog, dat die gemeenskap die posisie van die voormalige gade
nie as beskermingswaardig beskou nie. Dit volg nie. Dat die Wetgewer een euwel of leemte
besweer, regverdig nie die afleiding dat ’n ander euwel of leemte óf nie bestaan nie óf nie
aandag verdien nie.
Kortom, daar is enersyds genoegsame positiewe redes om die geskeide vrou wat oor ’n
hofbevel in haar guns beskik tegemoet te kom deur haar by die klas van afhanklikes in te sluit
aan wie so ’n aksie verleen word; en andersyds, in die [24] woorde van Innes R in Union
Government (Minister of Railways and Harbours) v Warneke, supra, 665:
""... there is no reason why our Courts should not similarly adapt the doctrine and
reasoning of the law to the conditions of modern life, so far as that can be done
without doing violence to its principles.""
Om gemelde redes behoort die appèl na my mening te misluk.
Dit laat die twee vrae wat by wyse van kruisappèl geopper is. Albei is in die alternatief tot die
hoofeis ingeklee. En waar dit die geval is, het die advokaat vir die eiseres die hof tydens
betoog meegedeel dat hy dié kwessies laat vaar. Ten opsigte van albei bestaan daar, op die
feite waarop ooreengekom is, op die oog af in elk geval afdoende antwoorde, waarop dit,
vanweë die toegewing, egter nie nodig is om verder in te gaan nie.
Die appèl word van die hand gewys met koste, insluitend die koste van twee advokate. Die
kruisappèl misluk met koste.

JUDGMENT

STREICHER JA/

STREICHER JA:
[1] 
The appellants are the trustees of the Schuster=s River Trust No
1 (Athe Trust@). They are the registered owners of a property at present
described as Remainder of Erf 766 Scarborough (Aerf 766""). The respondent
is the Surveyor-General, Cape Town. During about May 1921 the
respondent approved a general plan, S91 (AS91""), in respect of a proposed
township named The Schoester=s Kraal Township No 1 (ASchoesters Kraal
Township@) which had been laid out, surveyed and beaconed by land
surveyor Fischer. Erf 766 formed part of Schoesters Kraal Township and
was divided into 16 lots numbered 664 to 679. On 16 January 1996 the
respondent approved subdivisional diagrams in respect of the lots numbered
664 to 670 and renumbered them erven 935 to 940. However, shortly
thereafter the respondent requested the Registrar of Deeds to ensure that no
registration of transfer of the erven was effected. The respondent=s attitude

is that AS91"" had been replaced by another general plan, S101 (AS101""),
which did not include erf 766, and that the subdivision was prohibited in
terms of the Land Use Planning Ordinance 15 of 1985 (Cape) (Athe Land
Use Planning Ordinance@). As a result a caveat was placed against the
transfer of the six erven. An application by the appellants for an order
declaring that the respondent acted unlawfully was dismissed by the court a
quo. This is an appeal, with the leave of the court a quo, against the
dismissal of the appellants' application.
[2] 
In terms of s 23(1) of the Land Use Planning Ordinance no
person may subdivide land except in accordance with an application
granted under s 25 of the Ordinance unless the Premier (previously the
Administrator) has exempted the subdivision from the relevant provisions
of the Ordinance.  However, s 23(2) provides that land which on the date of

commencement of the Townships Ordinance 33 of 1934 (Cape) (Athe
Townships Ordinance, 1934@) had been laid out as a township or had been
subdivided by means of an actual survey into erven and public places and
the plan of which had been registered in the office of the Surveyor-General
concerned, shall be deemed to be a confirmed subdivision for the purposes
of the Ordinance.   S 6 of the Townships Ordinance, 1934 also required the
establishment of a township and the subdivision of land to be done in
accordance with that Ordinance unless it was land which at the
commencement thereof had been laid out as a township or which had been
subdivided by means of actual survey into erven and public places and the
plan of which had been registered in the office of the Surveyor-General.    S
6 of the Townships Ordinance 13 of 1927 (Cape) (Athe Townships
Ordinance, 1927""), which was the predecessor of the Townships Ordinance,
1934, and which came into operation on 2 December 1927, contained a

similar provision in respect of the establishment of townships.
[3] 
Before the Townships Ordinance, 1927 came into operation
town planning was not regulated, otherwise  than by way of limited powers
of control granted to certain municipalities. Since erf 766 was not then
situated within a municipal area such control measures are not relevant to
this matter. Whenever an owner of a larger tract of land wanted to sell off a
piece of the land, all that was required was for a transfer diagram to be
prepared by a qualified land surveyor on which the cadastral boundaries of
the land to be transferred, were shown. These boundaries had to be noted on
the diagram of the ""parent property"". With the advent of township
developments it became customary to prepare general plans. These were
plans, which were normally prepared by qualified land surveyors, which
showed the proposed layout of stands and which were prepared in order to
simplify and facilitate the process of transfer diagram preparation. If, for

example, two hundred erven were to be deducted from the ""parent property""
it would become progressively more difficult to show each successive
deduction on the diagram of the ""parent property"".
[4] 
The Schoesters Kraal Township consisted of 679 erven. Erven
664-679 (now erf 766) were separated from the rest of the township by a
roadway. Between May 1921 and July 1923 a number of the erven shown
on S 91, other than 664 - 679, were transferred to new owners. Most of the
erven were transferred in batches. As could be expected the portions of
land transferred were described as lots, with their appropriate numbers, in
the Schoesters Kraal Township No 1.
[5] 
On 13 July 1923 all the  remaining land shown on S91, was
consolidated with some additional land and transferred to Messrs Seeton
and Le Sueur. The consolidated land so transferred was described as
Scarborough Estates. The land was surveyed and beaconed by land

surveyor Fischer in May 1923 and transfer diagram no A1276/1923 in
respect thereof was approved by the respondent. According to a note on
diagram A1276/1923 one is to look at S91 for the subdivision of the land
depicted on  that plan.
[6] 
Subsequent to the aforesaid consolidation and transfer of land
Messrs Seeton and Le Sueur, on 14 November 1924, obtained a certificate
of registered title in respect of all the land depicted on  S91 excluding the
lots that had been transferred and excluding erf 766. The land in respect of
which the certificate of registered title was issued was described as
Scarborough Township. The land was surveyed and beaconed by land
surveyor Fischer in July 1923 and the diagram in respect thereof, diagram
no A2379/1923, was approved by the respondent on 8 August 1923. For the
subdivision of the property depicted on this diagram one is, according to a

note on the diagram, to look at S101. S101 is a general plan of the
Scarborough Township i.e. of the area that was previously known as the
Schoesters Kraal Township, excluding the erven that had been transferred
and excluding erf 766. It shows the locality of the lots which were excluded
at the time of transfer. In the case of lots which had been transferred in
batches it shows the outer boundaries of the batches. Save as aforesaid there
is no material difference between S91 and S101. After the approval of S101
and for some time before the Townships Ordinance, 1927 came into
operation, lots excluded from S101 were transferred and deducted with
reference to S91 and lots shown on S101 were transferred and deducted
with reference to S101.
[7] 
In 1935 the remainder of Scarborough Estates was transferred
to Scarborough Seaside Estates (Pty) Ltd which in turn, on 26 June 1936,
transferred erf 766 to Leslie Simpson. The property (erf 766), according to

diagram no 1909/1936, had been surveyed in May 1923, i.e. at the time that
the consolidated Scarborough Estates was surveyed, and the transfer
diagram was approved on 27 May 1936. The property was described as
APortion RK portion of The Scarborough Estates@. No subdivisions were
shown on the diagram but it does contain a notation to the effect that the
original diagram is no 1276 of 1923.
[8] 
The court a quo dismissed an argument by the appellants that
S91, in so far as it related to erf 766, could only be cancelled with the
consent of the owners of erven in the township or with the sanction of the
court and concluded that there had been a valid partial cancellation of the
township in respect of erf 766; that the subdivisional rights previously
attaching to erf 766 had been abandoned and that S91 had been cancelled in
so far as erf 766 was concerned. The judge a quo said:
AI am well aware that people do not lightly abandon their rights and I

am familiar with the case law which recognises this position. . . . But
I cannot see what interpretation to put upon the known facts other
than the obvious one: which in my opinion is that Messrs. Seeton and
Le Sueur, for reasons which satisfied them, resolved upon the partial
cancellation of the township in respect of erven 664 to 679; and that
effect thereto was given by the preparation, filing and acceptance of
general plan S.101. The subsequent transfer to Simpson of Portion
RK is consistent with this conclusion.@

[9] 
The appellants rely on the provisions of s 23(2) of the Land
Use Planning Ordinance. They can only succeed if on the date of
commencement of the Townships Ordinance, 1934, erf 766 had been laid
out as a township or had been subdivided by means of actual survey into
erven and public places and if the plan in respect thereof had been
registered in the office of the respondent. It is apparent from the aforegoing
and admitted by the respondent that that happened. However, the
respondent contends that S91 was cancelled and replaced by S101 with the
exception of the excluded lots specifically mentioned.

[10] In the light of the conclusion to which I came it is not
necessary to decide whether the appellants or the respondent bore the onus
of proof in respect of the defence raised by the respondent.  I shall assume
in the appellants' favour that the respondent bore such onus.
[11] The court a quo interpreted the respondent=s defence as an
assertion that the rights that had previously attached to erf 766 had been
abandoned. Strictly speaking that categorisation is not correct. A
cancellation of S91, in so far as it related to erf 766, would not, before the
Townships Ordinance, 1927 came into operation, have precluded a
subsequent subdivision of erf 766. All that was required for a subdivision
was that a transfer diagram be prepared by a qualified land surveyor. The
right to subdivide would therefore not have been affected by a cancellation
of S91.
[12] No direct evidence that S91 was replaced and cancelled by

S101 was tendered. There is also no evidence that such evidence would
have existed had such a replacement and cancellation been effected. It
follows that no adverse inference can be drawn from the fact that such
evidence was not tendered. There are however a  number of indications that
the owners of Scarborough Estates i.e. the owners of the land that formerly
comprised Schoesters Kraal Township, as well as the respondent, intended
S101 to replace S91 and thereby to cancel S91 save in so far as it related to
lots in Schoesters Kraal Township which had been transferred by 13 July
1923.
[13] Firstly, I can think of no reason and the appellants were unable
to suggest any, why Seeton and Le Sueur would not have included erf 766
in the certificate of registered title taken out by them and in the new general
plan if they still intended the whole area comprising the Schoesters Kraal
Township to constitute a township.

[14] Schoesters Kraal Township was laid out on portions of two
properties namely the farm Kogelfontein and the farm Schoesterskraal. Mr
Beyers, a land surveyor, whose supporting affidavit and replying affidavit
was filed by the appellants, suggested two reasons why S101 was framed.
Firstly, so he suggested, the new owners probably wanted to give the
property a new name namely Scarborough Township as opposed to the two
names Kogelfontein and Schoesters Kraal and, secondly, they probably
wanted to remove the boundary between Schoesterskraal and Kogelfontein.
However, that does not explain why erf 766 was omitted. Beyers said that
the reasons for not showing lots 664 to 679 on A2379/23 or S101 were
irrelevant. He added that it could simply have been an error or that the
owner could have decided not to develop that section of the township at that
stage and to save the costs of the land surveyor for including those erven. It

is so unlikely that erf 766 was omitted by error that the possibility of an
error can be excluded. Furthermore, the costs of including erf 766 which
had already been surveyed, beaconed and included in S91 would have been
minimal. In the words of appellants= own counsel AS101 did no more than to
reiterate (in identical form) S91, save insofar as it does not show Erf 766
(or Portion RK as it was then known)@. The suggestion that erf 766 was
omitted from S101 in order to save costs is therefore also without merit.
[15] Secondly, in terms of regulation 89 of the regulations
promulgated under the Land Survey Act, 9 of 1927 (Notice 1997 published
in Government Gazette 1739 of 23 November 1928) the subdivisional
diagram of a property reflected on a general plan should contain the
following note: AFor subdivision of the whole of this diagram vide General
Plan ...@. However, the subdivisional diagram of erf 766, which was
approved by the respondent in 1936, did not refer to S91 as it should have

done if S91 had not been cancelled in so far as erf 766 was concerned.
Diagram A1276/1923 does have a note on it to the effect that for
subdivision of the property comprising the Schoesters Kraal Township one
should look at S91. However, in terms of the regulation referred to, that
note should have appeared on the subdivisional diagram, if S91 was still
alive.
[16] Thirdly, regulation 10 of the regulations promulgated under    s
59 of the Deeds Registries Act, 13 of 1918 (Notice 1500 published in
Government Gazette 928 of 22 November 1918) provided that in describing
land in a deed, in the case of land situate in a township, the name of the
township should be quoted. For this reason, had S91 not been cancelled in
so far as erf 766 is concerned, one would have expected  the description of
erf 766 in subdivisional diagram 1909/1936 to have been Alots 664 - 679,
Schoester=s Kraal Township No 1"". That is the way in which lots transferred

in batches between May 1921 and July 1923 and deducted from S91 were
described. However, erf 766 was described as Aportion RK portion of The
Scarborough Estates@.
[17] In my view the most probable inference that can be drawn
from the aforegoing circumstantial evidence is that the owners of erf 766
intended S101 to replace S91 and to cancel S91 in so far as it related to erf
766. Furthermore, that the respondent understood that to have been the
owners= intention and that by approving S101 he was agreeing to such
cancellation of S91.   In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I am
satisfied that it has been proved on a balance of probabilities that S101
replaced S91 save in respect of lots that had already been sold and that S91
was thereby cancelled in so far as erf 766 was concerned.
[18] The appellants submitted that in terms of s 30(2) of the Land

Survey Act, 9 of 1927 the respondent was only empowered to cancel a
general plan with the consent of the Premier of the Province of the Western
Cape (previously the Administrator) or if ordered to do so by an order of
court and that the position prior to 2 December 1927, when the Townships
Ordinance 1927 came into operation, was the same in respect of existing
townships. However, s 30(2) was amended in 1941 and again in 1981.
Before its amendment in 1941 it provided that the Surveyor-General could
amend or alter a general plan but qualified the Surveyor-General=s authority
to do so where such amendment or alteration affected a public place within
the jurisdiction of a local authority authorized by law to close or partially
close any such public place or where it had the effect of creating a new
public place within the jurisdiction of such local authority . The appellants
also argued that the practice appeared to have been that a court order was
required for the approval of a new general plan or  the alteration of an

existing general plan. In this regard they relied on Marais v Surveyor-
General 1930 CPD 291 (AMarais@) and Ex parte Mossel River Estate Co
Ltd 19 CTR 1072 (AMossel@). In Marais the Surveyor-General refused to
register a new general plan in respect of portion of a township without an
order of court. However, from the petition in the matter it appears that the
alteration of the existing general plan eliminated existing roads and
substituted other roads therefor. In Mossel the court=s sanction was sought
and granted in respect of the diversion of a portion of a road. In the present
case no public places were affected by the alteration of the existing general
plan. It follows that neither the Land Survey Act, 9 of 1927 nor the two
cases referred to, support or are authority for the proposition that an order
of court was required for the alteration in question. No other authority was
referred to in support of the contention and there would appear to be no
basis for finding that the law was as suggested by the appellants. I therefore

conclude that the cancellation in question did not require the sanction of the
court.

[19] The appeal is dismissed with costs.

Date of hearing : 16 March 1999
Date of judgment : 26 March 1999
Labour tenant - eviction - interpretation of definition of labour tenant in the Land
Reform (Labour Tenants) Act, 3 of 1996
JUDGMENT
OLIVIER JA :
[1] The two appeals before us require an interpretation of the definition of
""labour tenant"" as the term is used in the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act 3 of
1996 (""the Act""). The appeals were heard on the same day, deal with some
common issues, and are conveniently decided in one judgment. For the sake of
clarity they will be referred to as the Salimba and the Van Rensburg appeal

respectively. Central to both appeals is the interpretation of sec 1 of the Act.
[2] Sec 1 of the Act provides :
In this section ""labour tenant"" means a person
(a) who is residing or has the right to reside on a farm;
(b) who has or has had the right to use cropping or grazing land on the
farm, referred to in paragraph (a), or another farm of the owner, and in
consideration of such right provides or has provided labour to the owner
or lessee; and
(c) whose parent or grandparent resided or resides on a farm and had
the use of cropping or grazing land on such farm or another farm of the
owner, and in consideration of such right provided or provides labour to
the owner or lessee of such or such other farm, including a person who
has been appointed as a successor to a labour tenant in accordance with
the provisions of section 3 (4) and (5), but excluding a farmworker.
A ""farmworker"" is defined as
a person who is employed on a farm in terms of a contract of
employment which provides that -
(a) in return for the labour which he or she provides to the
owner or lessee of the farm, he or she shall be paid
predominantly in cash or in some other form of remuneration,
and not predominantly in the right to occupy and use land; and
(b) he or she is obliged to perform his or her services personally.
""Owner"" is defined with reference to sec 102 of the Deeds Registries Act
47 of 1937, with the addendum ...and where it occurs in the definition of ‘labour
tenant’ includes his or her successors and predecessors in title.
[3] The Salimba appeal
At the end of a trial in the court a quo, Hurt J found that the Respondent
(Salimba) was the owner of a farm known as Rose Cottage in the Byrne area in
KwaZulu-Natal; that the Appellants and members of their families, though
occupiers of the land, were not labour tenants in terms of the Act. The learned
judge consequently granted an order ejecting them from the land in question. The
appeal is before us with leave of the court a quo.
The land under discussion has been owned since 1936 by various owners.
Salimba became the owner in 1994. The Appellants claim that they and their
family predecessors were, at all times relevant to this action, residing in the farm

and rendering certain duties to the owners in consideration of their being allowed
to cultivate lands and pasture stock for their own benefit.
Salimba instituted action in the Natal High Court for an order ejecting the
Appellants. Following Graham v Ridley 1931 TPD 476 and Chetty v Naidoo
1974 (3) SA 13 (A) it merely alleged that it was the owner of the land and that the
Appellants were occupying the land.
However, sec 5 of the Act clearly states that, subject to certain exceptions, a
labour tenant or his or her associate may be evicted only in terms of an order of
the Land Claims Court (""the LCC"") issued under the Act. The effect of this
provision is that if a person is a ""labour tenant"" in terms of the Act, the High
Court has no jurisdiction to eject him or her from the property in respect of which
tenancy is claimed. The issue before the court a quo and now this Court is
whether the Appellants are ""labour tenants"" in terms of the Act - a question of
interpretation properly within the jurisdiction of the High Court and also of this
Court. If the High Court correctly found that the Appellants were not labour
tenants then it could grant an ejection order, there being no other ground upon
which they claimed a right to occupy. If, on the other hand, the court a quo had
correctly found that the Appellants were labour tenants, then not it but only the
LCC could adjudicate upon a claim for ejectment.
The issue, then, is simply whether, on the facts found by the court a quo and the
correct interpretation of the Act, Hurt J was right in holding that the Appellants
were not labour tenants and thus ordering their ejectment.
[4] It was common cause in the court a quo that the second and the fourth
Appellants had not brought themselves within the ambit of requirement (c) of the
definition of labour tenant in the Act, because neither of them had tendered any
evidence to the effect that their parents or grandparents had rendered services in
return for rights of occupation and use of the portion of the farms on which they
worked. If the definition requires a person to bring herself or himself within all
three paragraphs of the definition, i.e. (a), (b) and (c), the second and fourth
Appellants have no defence to the action for ejectment brought against them by
Salimba.
The crux of the legal issue in respect of these two Appellants, therefore, is this :
should paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition be read conjunctively (or, what
amounts to the same, cumulatively) or, what was termed by counsel disjunctively,
so that compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) would suffice. Hurt J found in
favour of the conjunctive interpretation.

[5] In respect of the first and third Appellants two other issues arose:
firstly, whether the ""owner"" of the farm as defined, where the Appellant’s parent
or grandparent lived and provided tenant labour, or a successor of that owner,
must be the owner also of the farm on which the Appellant lives and provides
labour. Secondly, on whom the onus rests to prove that the alleged labour tenant
was not a farmworker. On both issues Hurt J found against the Appellants.
In the result, Hurt J also ordered these Appellants to vacate the land
occupied by them.
[6] The Van Rensburg appeal
The Appellant and another applicant applied in the LCC for an interdict
preventing the Deputy Sheriff for the magisterial district of Babanango from
executing a warrant for their ejectment from the land occupied by them, issued at
the instance of the owner, Mr van Rensburg. The application was refused on the
basis that the Applicants were not labour tenants as defined in the Act.
At the trial it was found by Dodson J, delivering the judgment of the
LCC, that neither of the applicants had complied with paragraph (b) of the
definition, because they had never worked or provided labour to Mr van
Rensburg or his predecessors in title. The application was refused.
This factual finding was not attacked on appeal before us. The legal dispute is in
essence similar to the one in respect of the second and fourth Appellants in the
Salimba appeal : should paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition be read
conjunctively, to the detriment of the Appellant, or disjunctively, in which case
compliance with only paragraphs (a) and (c) would still be sufficient for the
appeal to be upheld.
[7] On behalf of the Appellants it was argued in both courts a quo that, on a
proper interpretation of the Act, a person qualifies as a ""labour tenant"" if he or
she satisfies paragraphs (a) and either (b) or (c). It was argued that paragraphs
(a), (b) and (c) of the definition fall to be read disjunctively for the following
reasons : -
The intention of the legislature could not have been that the three paragraphs be read
conjunctively, because such a reading would in substantial measure stultify the object of
the Act and lead to injustice. The object of the Act is to protect those who traditionally
rendered labour in exchange for the right to occupy and use land from eviction at the
whim of the owner of the land subject only to compliance with the common law
requirement of reasonable notice. If a 70 year old person claims to be a labour tenant
on a farm where she or he was born and has lived all her or his life and to have satisfied
the requirements of paragraph (b), the legislature could not have intended that the
enquiry be extended to determine what such a person’s parents’ occupations had been

or where they had lived. In practice this would more often than not be impossible to
determine or check or verify.
It was argued that the widest possible meaning should be given to the concept of
a labour tenant to ensure that as many as possible of the victims of this form of
racial discrimination are protected. In order to achieve this a disjunctive reading
of the definition is called for, because a conjunctive interpretation would not give
effect to this intention and in fact would result in unfair consequences, for
example :
(i) The so-called first generation labour tenant is afforded no protection,
notwithstanding the fact that such a person may have been a labour tenant for many
years, perhaps all his working life, whereas the second generation labour tenant is
protected, notwithstanding the fact that he and his parent combined may not have been
labour tenants for long at all.
(ii) The situation described by Meskin J in his judgment in the Tselentis
Mining (Pty) Ltd and Another v Mdlalose and Others 1998 (1) SA 411 (N) case
at 418 H - 419 B, could arise :
A person (A) who qualifies as a labour tenant as at 2 June 1995 in terms of paragraphs
(a) and (b) of the definition of ""labour tenant"" has a son (B). A person (C) who
qualifies as a labour tenant as at 2 June 1995 in terms of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the
definition of ""labour tenant"" has a son (D). As at 2 June 1995 each of B and D resided
or had a right to reside on the relevant farm, but neither B nor D had the rights
envisaged by paragraph (b) of the definition. A is alive as at 22 March 1996, the date of
commencement of the Act. A can ensure that B has the benefits of the occupation and
use of the relevant part of the farm and the concomitant rights by appointing B as his
successor (section 3 (3) (b)) or, if A dies without appointing a successor, A’s family
can appoint B as A’s successor (section 3(4)). C has died before 22 March 1996. There
is no way in which (absent paragraph (c) of the definition of ""labour tenant"") D can
acquire the relevant benefits notwithstanding that C, his father, enjoyed such benefits.
This is manifestly unfair to D, who is prejudiced, as against B, by the mere accident that
C has died before 22 March 1996, whereas A is alive as at such date. The legislature
can hardly have intended such prejudice to exist. Certainly no reason for such
discrimination as between B and D occurs to me or, in my opinion, appears from the
Act.
These injustices outweigh the suggested anomalies resulting from the disjunctive
approach.
Professor J.M. Pienaar in an article entitled ""Labour tenancy : recent
developments in case law"" in volume 9, no 3 Stellenbosch Law Review, 1998 at
311 et seq. argued that a person could qualify as a labour tenant for purposes of
the Act if his or her grandparent or parent provided labour against the right to
grazing while residing on the farm. Persons could therefore qualify as labour

tenants in terms of paragraphs (a) and (b) when the actual physical use and
occupation of the farm was through parents or grandparents, although the right to
reside on the farm and the rights of cropping and grazing were in fact vested in
the person establishing labour tenancy (see p 321).
As regards the meaning of paragraph (c) Professor Pienaar relies on
the following dictum of Meskin J in the Tselentis-case, supra, at 418 F-G:
The intention of the Legislature is not ... to make it a sine qua non of qualification as a
labour tenant that as at 2 June 1995 one’s parent or grandparent had these rights in
addition to the fact that one oneself had such rights as at such date; the intention was to
create an additional means by which a person who as at 2 June 1995 resided or had the
right to reside on the farm but who did not have in his own right the rights to use
cropping or grazing on such farm can nevertheless qualify as a labour tenant if his
parent or grandparent in the latter’s own right had such rights. One can readily
understand why the Legislature has made such provision.
It was finally submitted on behalf of the Appellants that the decisions in Tselentis
Mining (Pty) Ltd and Another v Mdlalose & Others , supra, at 420 G - H and
Klopper and Others v Mkhize and Others 1998 (1) SA 406 (NPD) at 408 are to
be preferred to the decisions of Mahlangu v De Jager 1996 (3) SA 235 (LCC)
and Zulu and Others v Van Rensburg and Others 1996 (4) SA 1236 (LCC) and
Ngcobo and Another v Van Rensburg and Others 1997 (4) All SA 537 (LCC).
[7] The Respondents relied on the following arguments as support for their
contention that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) should be read conjunctively.
They supported the analysis by Dodson J in the court a quo in the Van Rensburg
case, reported as Ngcobo and Another v van Rensburg and Others, supra, at 541
c - h :
. There can be no quarrel with the suggestion that the definition must be read in its
context and with due regard to the objects of the Act. However, there are flaws in Mr
Rall’s argument. The interpretation of the definition for which he contends does not
require a simple disjunctive reading of the word ‘and’ between paragraphs (b) and (c).
A simple disjunctive reading would give ‘and’ the meaning ‘or’. This the courts will
quite readily do if the proper application of the rules of statutory interpretation justify
it. Hence the following extract from the judgment of Dowling J in R v La Joyce (Pty)
Ltd and another:
The authorities .. show that the Courts are not so slow to read ‘and’ for ‘or’ or
‘or’ for ‘and’ in cases where such a course appears better to give effect to the
obvious intention of the Legislature and the scheme of the Act.
But this is not what we are asked by counsel for the appellants to find. Rather, the
meaning which he seeks to attribute to the word ‘and’ requires a significant

modification of the definition, so that a labour tenant would in fact be a person -
(a) who is residing or has the right to reside on a farm; and either
(b) [who] has or has had the right to use cropping or grazing
land on the farm referred to in paragraph (a), or another
farm of the owner, and in consideration of such right
provides or has provided labour to the owner or lessee;
[and] or
(c) whose parent or grandparent resided or resides on a farm and
had the use of cropping or grazing land on such farm or
another farm of the owner, and in consideration of such
right provided or provides labour to the owner or lessee
of such or such other farm ,including a person who has
been appointed a successor to a labour tenant in
accordance with the provisions of s 3(4) and (5), but
excluding a farm worker.
Thus one must read in the word ‘and either’ at the end of paragraph (a), delete the
word ‘who’ in paragraph (b) and read ‘or’ for ‘and’ at the end of paragraph (b)
.
The word ‘and’ at the end of paragraph (b) would in its ordinary grammatical
sense only indicate that paragraph (c) contains an additional requirement to be
complied with. If regard is had to the context of the word ""and"" at the end of
paragraph (b) of the definition, it is clear that the word was intended to be used in
its usual conjunctive or cumulative sense. By doing so the result would not be
unreasonable, inconsistent or unjust.
The Act is intended to protect a very particular class of rural tenant and in
determining that class of tenant paragraphs (b) and (c) must also be complied
with. Zulu and Others v van Rensburg and Others, supra, page 1254 C - E. To
conclude as Galgut J did in Klopper and Others v Mkhize and Others, supra,
that :
It may well have been intended that paragraph (a) and (b) must read conjunctively, but
it seems ... that the further intention was that paragraph (c) must either be read on its
own or conjunctively with paragraph (a) only ...
could lead to absurd results. If paragraph (c) is read on its own then a person
living in the city who does not reside on a particular farm and never did and has
no right to reside on that particular farm, but whose grandparents at the turn of the
century happened to have resided on a particular farm and had the use of
cropping or grazing land on not even that farm but another farm owned by the
same owner and in consideration provided labour to the owner or lessee, would
qualify as a labour tenant and have rights in terms of the Act. The legislature

could hardly have intended such a result.
If paragraph (c) of the definition is to be read conjunctively with paragraph (a)
only, then the qualification contained in paragraph (b) would be ignored, which is
also an untenable interpretation as it ignores the express wording of paragraph
(b).
In interpreting the definition of ""labour tenant"" it is important to bear in mind that
although a purposive approach might be appropriate, a finding that a person
qualifies as a ""labour tenant"" detracts from the registered owner’s real rights in
and to his property which
(i) he enjoys at common law;
(ii) are guaranteed in terms of Section 25 of the Constitution Act
No 108 of 1996.
In the final analysis, a bald statement that a conjunctive reading of the
requirements would ""in substantial measure stultify the object of the Act and lead
to injustice"" (Appellants’ words) is of no assistance as it must be kept in mind
that the Act seeks to strike a balance between labour tenants and owners. In the
words of Hurt J in the court a quo in the Salimba appeal :
The important feature of the Act insofar as the disputes in this action are concerned, is
that it affects and regulates the rights of ‘labour tenants’ (who may fairly be called the
‘beneficiaries’ of its provisions) on the one hand and owners of the property to which
the ‘labour tenants’ lay claim (whether in the form of rights of use and occupation or as
aspirant owners) on the other.
Finally it could not have been the intention of the legislature that the provisions of
paragraph (b) should be excluded. The providing of labour by the person who
seeks to be declared a labour tenant or who alleges that he is a labour tenant is a
necessary ingredient of the concept of labour tenancy. It is unthinkable that the
legislature had in mind to declare a person a labour tenant if he himself had not
provided any labour as is required by paragraph (b) of the definition and only his
father or grandfather had done so as referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition.
[9] As far as the decisions of the High Court and the LCC are concerned,
only those of Galgut J in Klopper and Others v Mkhize and Others, supra, and
of Meskin J in Tselentis Mining (Pty) Ltd and Another v Mdlalose and Others,
supra, for the reasons mentioned above, support the view advanced by the
Appellants.
[10] On the other hand, there are a number of decisions that firmly favour the
view taken by the Respondents. I mention them and the main reasons advanced in
the judgments.

In the case of P.A. Jacobz N.O. and Others v G. Mbongwa and Others, an
unreported decision in Case No 3700/95 in the High Court of South Africa, Natal
Provincial Division, delivered on 29 March 1996, Thirion J said the following :
To my mind it is clear that in the definition of labour tenant paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
should be read conjunctively. That much I think becomes clear from a reading of the
recital of the objects of the Act. There is also a recital of the history of discriminatory
laws and practices which are said to have led to the systematic breach of human rights
and the denial of access to land. It is clear that the Act sets about to deal with an
historical situation - a situation which has been of long standing in this province, where
farmers used to permit labourers to reside on their farms and graze cattle and plant
crops on a piece of land set aside for that purpose - all this in return for their providing
labour for the farmer. I have come to a conclusion therefore that the definition of
labour tenant embraces all three paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).
In Mahlangu v de Jager, supra, a full bench decision, Gildenhuys J delivering
the judgment, rejected the argument that only paragraph (a) needs to be complied
with. He stated (at 242 B) that if that were the case, it is difficult to understand
why paragraphs (b) and (c) were included in the definition.
In Zulu and Others v Van Rensburg and Others, supra, Dodson J firmly rejected
the disjunctive approach and said the following at 1253 H - 1254 E :
This Court held in the matter of Mahlangu v de Jager that the definition requires that, in
order to qualify as a labour tenant, there must be compliance cumulatively with
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition. It is indeed so that the word and can in
certain circumstances be read disjunctively ..... If regard is had to the context of the
word and at the end of paragraph (b) of the definition, it is plain that the word was
intended to be used in its usual conjunctive or cumulative sense. To hold
otherwise would give rise to absurd results. For example, an ordinary
tenant could show that he or she resided on a farm and did not qualify as a
farmworker. This would, on a disjunctive interpretation, qualify all ordinary lessees of
farmland who reside on the farm as labour tenants. Moreover the implications of sec 6
of the Act would be that they would also have an option to purchase the farmland.
Plainly this was never intended by the Legislature. The Act is intended to protect a very
particular class of rural tenant and in isolating that class of tenant paragraphs (b) and
(c) must come into play.
In the court a quo in Salimba’s case, Hurt J in a well-reasoned judgment held
that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition of labour tenant should be read
conjunctively. He stated the following :
The interpretation arrived at in the Tselentis case postulates that a person who satisfies
requirements (a) and (c) will fall within the definition of a ‘labour tenant’. The result
would be that any person, other than a farm worker, as defined, who has the right to
reside on a farm and whose grandparent satisfied the requirements in paragraph (c)

would fall within the ambit of the definition. For reasons which I will state later, I
consider that the words ‘a farm’ in paragraph (c) must be given a restrictive
interpretation, but even if this is not done the consequences of an interpretation which
requires only elements (a) and (c) to be met for a person to qualify as a ‘labour tenant’
provide a broad spectrum of absurdity. It would result in people who do not fall within
what the preamble to the Act refers to as ‘the present institution of labour tenancy in
South Africa’ being given the statutory protection and benefits conferred by the Act
upon ‘labour tenants’. In deciding whether such a result is absurd, one does not look
only at the position of the ‘labour tenant’ but also at the position of the ‘owner’ who is,
obviously, the ‘other party’ affected by the provisions of the Act. The Act stated the
legislator’s general intention fairly clearly in the preamble. I do not think that it can, by
the furthest stretch of imagination, be said that the Act was intended to benefit a class
of people who do not fall within the ambit of element (b) of the definition but whose
grandparents were ‘labour tenants’ within the meaning of that term as used before the
advent of the Act. It follows that I am of the view that the so-called disjunctive
interpretation is not in accordance with the intention of the legislator and I consider
that a person cannot be treated as a ‘labour tenant’ unless he satisfies all three elements
of the definition and is not a ‘farmworker’ as defined.
The learned Judge dealt with the conflicting decisions in Klopper and
Others v Mkhize and Others, supra and Tselentis Mining (Pty) Limited and
Another v Mdlalose and Others, supra, and came to the conclusion that they
were based on a wrong interpretation of the definition of labour tenant.
In the judgment of the court a quo in the Van Rensburg appeal, reported as
Ngcobo and Another v Van Rensburg and Others to which I have previously
referred, Dodson J, in a particularly lucid and helpful judgment, pointed out, as
mentioned above, that what the Appellants contend for was not a simple
disjunctive reading (see paragraph [7] above). But Dodson J also dealt with the
anomalies that would result from a conjunctive reading of paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c), to which I have already referred. Apart from technical responses to the
anomaly relied on by Meskin J in the Tselentis-case (as to which, see 543 b - g
of the Van Rensburg judgment), Dodson J, conceding the harshness in some
cases where the conjunctive approach is applied, stated (at 543 g - h) that the
introduction of legislation which confers new rights will always result in
unfortunate cases where qualifying criteria are not met by certain persons because
of events which preceded the coming into force of the new legislation. Such
cases, the learned judge remarked (at 543 h), cannot afford a basis for the
adoption of an interpretation which amounts to a modification of the legislation.
He also stated that the anomaly contemplated by Meskin J (if it is one - see
paragraph [7] above) is outweighed by the anomalies which arise on the
disjunctive interpretation. Dodson J was also of the opinion that the conjunctive
approach cannot be said to give rise to anything as extreme as absurdity. It
requires no modification of the definition, nor even the adoption of any secondary

or unusual meaning for any of the words in the definition (at 542 e - f).
However Dodson J (at 544 paragraphs [20] and [21] ) proceeded to point out that
absurd results do flow from a disjunctive interpretation of the definition.
What are the anomalies which arise on the disjunctive interpretation? Take the
example of a person who, on 2 June 1995, was and continues to be, a farm
worker who provides her services personally and is paid predominantly by way
of a cash salary but in part by way of rights to live on the farm and graze a few
cows or keep a vegetable patch. Such a person is clearly not intended to qualify
(no matter what her ancestry may be) because farm workers are expressly
excluded from the definition of a labour tenant. However the farm worker has
children who are allowed to live with her and have done so since at least 2 June
1995. Those children would then qualify as labour tenants in their own right
because they comply with paragraphs (a) and (c). Those children would then
have the significant rights afforded labour tenants under the Act, including the
right to have family members living with them. Family members would by
definition include their farm worker parent. That parent would then be able to
derive most of the benefits which she was excluded from by reason of her farm
worker status because she is a family member of her children. If she were
dismissed, eviction from the farm could be avoided by ensuring as guardian of
the children that they exercised their right under section 16 to acquire the portion
of the farm where they lived. This is an absurd situation which could never have
been intended.
The situation is all the more absurd if one considers that the farm referred to in
paragraph (c) of the definition need not be the same as the farm referred to in
paragraph (a). Thus in the example referred to above, the children would, on the
disjunctive interpretation, still have the rights of a labour tenant in relation to the
farm where they resided even if their parent is or was employed as a farm worker
on similar terms by a different farmer on a different farm. There are other
anomalies which are conceivable on the disjunctive interpretation, but in my view
those already mentioned are sufficient to illustrate the point.
Finally, Dodson J rejected the solution offered by Meskin J in the Tselentis -
case (and by Professor Pienaar in the article mentioned above), viz that in
satisfaction of paragraph (b) of the definition the labour can be provided by the
tenant’s parent or grandparent. He held that sec 3 (1) cannot be used to redefine
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition (at 546, paragraph [24] ), and held
that the suggested interpretation of Meskin J could not possibly have been
intended as an acceptable interpretation of the Act (at 546, paragraph [25] ).
In Van Niekerk v Nqonwange, an unreported judgment delivered on 19 August
1997 in the Transvaal High Court under case number 24921/96 (mentioned by
Dodson J in the Van Rensburg - case at 547 footnote 29), Du Plessis J differed
from the judgment of Galgut J in Klopper and Others v Mkhize and Others, and

held that paragraph (c) cannot be read on its own (see the quotation from this
case by Dodson J in Van Rensburg at 547, paragraph [26] ).
Finally, the Respondents’ interpretation was held to be the correct one in
Mosehla v Sancor cc 1999 (1) SA 614 (T) in a decision of the full bench of the
Transvaal Provincial Division (Van Dijkhorst and De Villiers JJ), Van
Dijkhorst J delivering the judgment. The learned judge firmly favoured the
conjunctive interpretation, rejected the views expressed in Klopper and Tselentis
Mining, and agreed with the decisions of the LCC in Mahlangu v De Jager and
Zulu and Others v Van Rensburg and Others. As regards the judgments of Galgut
J and Meskin J, he remarked (at 620 H - 621 A) , after referring to the object of
the
Act :
Whereas it may be perceived as unfair that a family which has for decades
occupied premises on a farm be evicted, there could be no injustice should a
worker who on 31 May 1995 joined the corps of employees on the basis that his
remuneration would be predominantly his use of land, be discharged for thieving
one month later and evicted from the farm. The Legislature could not have
intended to grant such employees security of tenure. Yet this is the consequence
of the two Natal judgments. This result is absurd.
[11] In my view, the conjunctive or cumulative interpretation of paragraphs (a),
(b) and (c) of the definition now under discussion is clearly the correct one.
It is unfortunately true that the words ""and"" and ""or"" are sometimes inaccurately
used by the legislature, and there are many cases in which one of them has been
held to be the equivalent of the other (see the remarks of Innes CJ in Barlin v
Licensing Court for the Cape 1924 A D at 478). Although much depends on the
context and the subject matter (Barlin at 478), it seems to me that there must be
compelling reasons why the words used by the legislature should be replaced; in
casu why ""and"" should be read to mean ""or"", or vice versa. The words should be
given their ordinary meaning "" ... unless the context shows or furnishes very
strong grounds for presuming that the legislature really intended"" that the word
not used is the correct one (see Wessels J in Gorman v Knight Central GM Co
Ltd 1911 TPD 597 at 610; my underlining). Such grounds will include that if we
give ""and"" or ""or"" their natural meaning, the interpretation of the section under
discussion will be unreasonable, inconsistent or unjust (see Gorman at 611) or
that the result will be absurd (Greyling and Erasmus (Pty) Ltd v Johannesburg
Local Road Transportation Board and Others, 1982 (4) SA 427 (A) at 444 C-D)
or, I would add, unconstitutional or contrary to the spirit, purport and objects of
the Bill of Rights (sec 39 (2) of the 1996 Constitution.) In this respect I draw
attention to what was said by Mahomed AJ in S v Acheson, 1991 (2) SA 805
(NmHC) at 813 A - B :

The constitution of a nation is not simply a statute which mechanically defines
the structures of government and the relations between the government and the
governed. It is a ‘mirror reflecting the national soul’, the identification of the
ideals and aspirations of a nation; the articulation of the values bonding its
people and disciplining its government. The spirit and tenor of the constitution
must therefore preside and permeate the processes of judicial interpretation and
judicial discretion.
In my view, none of these grounds is applicable when paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
of the definition are given their ordinary grammatical meaning, in particular when
""and"" at the end of paragraph (b) is read to mean ""and"". As pointed out above,
there are possible anomalies created by such interpretation (see especially the
examples developed by Meskin J in the Tselentis-case). Some or all of these
postulated anomalies may even result in unjust consequences. On the other hand,
there are also anomalies and unjust and even absurd consequences flowing from
the disjunctive approach, as pointed out by Dodson J in Zulu and Others v Van
Rensburg and Others, supra, at 1253 H - 1254 E; again by Dodson J in Ngcobo
and Another v Van Rensburg and Others, supra, at 544 paragraphs [20] and [21]
and Van Dijkhorst J in Mosehla v Sancor cc, supra, at 620 H - 621 A. I have
hereinbefore fully quoted the remarks of these judges in the relevant cases and do
not intend to dwell upon them in further detail. Suffice it to say that I agree with
the judgments that adopted the so-called conjunctive approach, and reject the
judgments in Klopper and Others v Mkhize and Others, supra, and Tselentis
Mining (Pty) Ltd and Another v Mdlalose and Others, supra, as regards this
aspect of the case.
[12] The result of this finding is that the appeal of the second and fourth
Appellants in the Salimba appeal must fail as the Appellants have not brought
themselves within the ambit of paragraph (c) of the definition. Likewise the
appeal of the Appellant in the Van Rensburg appeal fails as the Appellant has
failed to prove compliance with paragraph (b) of the definition.
[13] I have not come to this conclusion without a sense of sympathy for these
Appellants. They had to come to this Court at great expense simply because of
the bad and slovenly draftsmanship of the Act. They may have believed their
cause just and their case to have merit. They and many other occupiers of land
may be severely prejudiced by the anomalies and absurdities pointed out in the
cases to which I have referred. The legislature may wish to address these
anomalies.
It is important to keep in mind that the Act was intended to reform the legal
relationship that had prevailed between the owner of a farm and labour tenants
since the apartheid era. Under that regime, the ‘rights’ of those who served an

owner in return for the privilege of working and grazing pieces of land for their
own benefit were as illusory as they were precarious. These labour tenants
occupied the land at the whim of the landowner, who could eject them subject
only to compliance with the common-law requirement of reasonable notice. In our
country, land ownership was effectively beyond the reach of the majority of black
people - people who were, because of the apartheid system and its concomitant
discriminatory education system, kept in ignorance even of their rudimentary
rights. Rural people had little choice but to become either farmworkers, with no
prospect of building up even a minuscule estate, or tenant labourers, with no legal
protection of their tenancy. The last group was thus reduced to feudal
dependency : they had either to comply with the orders of the land owner, even if
harsh and unjust, or face the prospect of nomadic trekking and seeking, in an
unsympathetic environment, new land to occupy.
One of the main objects of the Act is to give labour tenants greater security. The
preamble of the Act reads as follows :
To provide for security of tenure of labour tenants and those persons occupying
or using land as a result of their association with labour tenants; to provide for
the acquisition of land and rights in land by labour tenants; and to provide for
matters connected therewith.
WHEREAS the present institution of labour tenancy in South Africa is the result
of racially discriminatory laws and practices which have led to the systematic
breach of human rights and denial of access to land;
WHEREAS it is desirable to ensure the adequate protection of labour tenants,
who are persons who were disadvantaged by unfair discrimination, in order to
promote their full and equal enjoyment of human rights and freedoms;
WHEREAS it is desirable to institute measures to assist labour tenants to obtain
security of tenure and ownership of land;
AND WHEREAS it is desirable to ensure that labour tenants are not further
prejudiced.
Meticulous and unambiguous craftsmanship when it comes to spelling out the
rights and duties of those to whom the legislation is applicable is the first
principle of legislative drafting. A draftsperson should give careful consideration
to the policy it is intended to enshrine in legislation and then formulate
appropriate enactments, not in vague or polyphonous terms, but in exact terms,
having in mind the consequences of what is intended to be said. I am not
convinced that the draftsperson has properly thought through all the situations that
can and will arise as a consequence of the wording of the definition of ""labour
tenant"" in the Act. The sheer number of cases that have come before the Courts

since the Act was put on the statute book as recently as 1996 speaks for itself and
must be a cause for grave concern.
[14] This brings me to the appeals of the first and third Appellants in the
Salimba appeal. As indicated above, two issues have to be decided : firstly,
whether the owner (or his successors) of the farm on which the Appellant’s
parent or grandparent lived and provided tenant labour must be the same as the
owner of the farm on which the Appellant was now living and providing tenant
labour; and, secondly, on whom the onus rests to prove that the alleged labour
tenant was not a farmworker. On both issues Hurt J found against the Appellants
and found that they failed to acquit themselves thereof.

It is clear that in order to succeed in their appeal the said Appellants have to be
successful on both issues.
[15] Must the owner (or his successors) of the farm on which the Appellant’s
parent or grandparent lived and provided tenant labour be the same as the owner
of the farm on which the Appellant was now living and providing tenant labour?
On the evidence, it is clear that the first Appellant’s parents were labour tenants
on the farm Kamby. He lived there with his parents, but when he married he
became a labour tenant on the farm now under discussion, viz. Rose Cottage.
There is no evidence that any of the owners of Rose Cottage owned Kamby. His
parents, therefore, were labour tenants on a farm owned by an owner other than
the owner of, the farm from which the first Appellant’s eviction is being sought.
A similar problem arose in respect of the third Appellant’s case.
[16] On behalf of said Appellants it was contended that paragraph (c) is cast in
wide terms, and only requires that the parents or grandparents of the present
defendant were or had been tenant labourers on a farm, owned by an owner
irrespective of whether such owner (or his successors) is also the owner of the
farm on which the present occupier is a labour tenant.
The contention was claimed to be supported by the consideration that whereas
paragraph (b) specifically refers to the farm ""in paragraph (a)"", requiring an
applicant applying in terms of paragraph (b) to satisfy requirements of paragraph
(a), paragraph (c) refers only to ""a"" farm. Had the legislature intended the farm in
paragraph (c) to be associated with that in paragraph (a) it would have said so as
it did in paragraph (b).
It was also submitted that Dodson J in the LCC in the case of Zulu and Others v
van Rensburg, supra, at page 1257 F correctly stated the position as follows :
One of the objects of the act is to provide labour tenants with certain protection

against eviction. In the past the common law left labour tenants exposed to
eviction at the whim of the owner of the land subject only to compliance with the
common law requirement of reasonable notice. Such a basis for eviction is now
excluded by the act if a person can show that he or she qualifies as a labour
tenant under the legislation. If we are to adopt Mr Roberts’ interpretation, a
person whose predecessors had over the generations consistently been labour
tenants (as that term was understood before the statutory definition was
enacted), but had been forced by evictions to move from farm to farm, would be
excluded, whilst a person whose father and who himself or herself had been
fortunate enough to avoid eviction would qualify. What then in effect becomes a
disqualifying criterion is the fact of past evictions, the very problem which the
act sought to deal with. A statute is presumed not to give rise to harsh or
discriminatory result.
It was finally submitted that there is no justification in narrowing the
interpretation of the definition to require the existence of a historical relationship
between the labour tenant’s family and a particular owner and his or her
successor in title.
[17] The Respondent took the opposite approach :
If paragraph (c) would be satisfied if the parent or grandparent of the labour
tenant resided on any other farm (""a farm"")where they had the use of cropping or
grazing land, then the words ""or another farm of the owner"" in the
paragraph would be superfluous, because ownership of the farm in question
would be irrelevant. This is contrary to the accepted canon of interpretation that
every word or phrase must be given a meaning.
In order for paragraph (c) to be satisfied, it was submitted, the parents or
grandparents of the person claiming to be a labour tenant residing on a particular
farm must also have resided on that particular farm and had the use of cropping or
grazing land on that same farm or ""another farm of the owner"" of such farm i.e.
there must be common ownership of the farm on which the labour tenant now
resides and the farm where his parent or grandparent resided (coupled with the
fact that in consideration of such right a parent or grandparent had to provide
labour to the owner or lessee of such or such other farm). The reference to ""such
farm or another farm of the owner"" clearly could only refer to ""such farm"" of the
owner or ""another farm of the owner"".
[18] The court a quo upheld the Respondent’s submission on this aspect, Hurt J
holding that the words ""a farm"" in paragraph (c) were not intended by the
legislature to bear the wide meaning of "" ... any farm, wheresoever situated and
owned by whomsoever."" The learned Judge stated :

Such a wide interpretation would mean that one of requirements for qualification
as a ‘labour tenant’ is, simply, that the claimant must have a grandparent or a
parent who was once a labour tenant under the old system. It must be borne in
mind that the Act is intended to entrench rights of occupation of property and
confer rights of acquisition of property to protect people who had, for practical
purposes, been bound to that property or its owner by the bonds of the feudal
tenant system over an appreciable period. It is clear that, in enacting the
requirement in paragraph (c) of the definition (referred to in the Ngcobo-case as
‘a second generational requirement’), the legislator was narrowing down the
class of people who would qualify for benefits under the Act to those whose
history of ‘labour tenancy’ stretched back more than a generation. As I have
already indicated, I think that it is fundamental to a proper construction of the
definition to bear in mind that the Statute was intended to regulate the dealings
as between ‘labour tenant and ‘owner’. Requirement (c) refers in general terms
to ‘a farm’ but it also refers to ‘the owner’. It is not without significance that the
Statute defines ‘owner’ with specific reference to the occurrence of that word in
the definition of ‘labour tenant’. The definition of ‘owner’ is as follows : -
‘Owner’ means the owner as defined in section 102 of the Deeds
Registries Act 1937 (Act 47 of 1937), of a farm, and where it
occurs in the definition of ‘labour tenant’ includes his or her
successors and predecessors in title.
It seems to me that the existence of a historical relationship between the labour
tenant’s family and ‘the owner’ (who will include all of the present owner’s
predecessors in title) was what was contemplated in requirement (c) and that this
paragraph should properly be so interpreted. Thus, in those cases where families
established themselves on a portion of a farm and that farm was then subdivided
and sold with the result that a grandchild was in occupation of a portion of one
subdivision and the grandparent in occupation of a portion of another,
requirement (c) would be satisfied, because the original owner of the undivided
farm would be included within the term ‘owner’ as used in requirement (c).
Conversely, this interpretation avoids the anomaly which would result from the
wide interpretation of ‘a farm’ without reference to the identity of the owner
where, for instance, a person who has satisfied (a) and (b) for a matter of months
on the farm of X would be able to claim the benefits of the Act as against X on
the ground that, many years ago, his grandparent had been a labour tenant (in the
old sense) on a farm belonging to Y.
[19] Hurt J, however, quite fairly also highlighted the other side of the argument
:
There is a significant change in language between paragraph (b) and paragraph
(c) of the definition of ‘labour tenant’. When paragraph (b) speaks of the farm on
which the ‘labour tenant’ has rights of use, it speaks of ‘the farm’, referred to in
paragraph (a). Paragraph (c) contains no such explicit reference to the farm
contemplated in paragraph (a). A significant change of language such as this
does, of course, give a clear indication that the legislator did not intend that the

farm on which the parent or grandparent resided or resides should be the farm
referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition and there are clear reasons why this
should not be so. In many instances in the old labour tenant system, when a
farmer sold a farm and moved to a new one, the labour tenants on that farm
moved with him. Moreover, until the advent of statutory limitations on the
subdivision of agricultural land, there were many instances where farms were
subdivided and subdivisions were sold while the labour tenants remained in
occupation and continued to render services to the new owner of the subdivision
on which they were dwelling. Equally, as time passed and the children of labour
tenants grew to maturity, the farmer might have required the children to take up
residence and render services on a different farm to that on which the parents or
grandparents were residing. In such situations it would, in my view, be
inconsistent with the purpose of the legislator to construe paragraph (c) in such a
manner as to require the parent or grandparent to reside, or to have resided, on
the same farm as that in respect of which the progeny claim rights.
[20] I respectfully disagree with the decision of Hurt J in the court a quo that the
rights under discussion should have been exercised by the present tenant and his
or her parent or grandparent on a farm or farms belonging to the same owner or
his or her predecessors or successors.
I am of the view that the change from ""the"" farm to ""a"" farm in the definition
cannot be ignored, i.e. that ""a"" cannot simply be replaced by ""the"". The same
reasoning which I have applied earlier in this judgment in respect of ""and"" and
""or"" would seem to me to be applicable.
I am not convinced that Hurt J in the court a quo was correct in saying that the
Act was intended to protect only those who had been bound to a property of the
same owner (or his predecessors or successors) by the bonds of a feudal labour
tenant system over an appreciable period, nor in saying that it was intended to
narrow down the class of persons who would qualify for benefits under the Act.
I believe on the contrary, that the view taken by Dodson J in Zulu and Others v
Van Rensburg, supra, and the contentions there advanced by him (see the
quotation in paragraph [10] hereinbefore) are correct (see also on this point
Meskin J in the Tselentis - case at 419 J - 420 B for the correct perspective). The
object of the Act was to give a wide and equitable protection to labour tenants
without ignoring the rights of the owners of farms. This balance can be achieved
more justly and equitably by adhering to the text of paragraph (c) of the definition,
rather than by substituting ""the"" for ""a"" farm.
[21] In the result, the first and third Appellants in the Salimba Appeal are
successful on this aspect of the case.

[22] It must still be decided, finally, whether these two Appellants were
""farmworkers"" as defined in the Act and, therefore, disqualified from being
""labour tenants"".
The definition of ""labour tenant"" in the Act (see paragraph [2] hereinbefore)
makes it clear that a farmworker cannot be a labour tenant at the same time. A
""farmworker"" is defined as a person employed on a farm who in terms of his
contract of employment is paid in cash or in some other form of remuneration and
not predominantly in the right to occupy and use land, and who is obliged to
perform his or her services personally (see paragraph [2] hereinbefore).
On behalf of the Respondent in the Salimba Appeal it was argued, on the facts,
that the first and third Appellants were farmworkers; the Appellants denied that
they fell within the terms of the definition.
Two questions arose : firstly, what stage and what duration in a person’s
occupancy of land must be considered to determine whether he is a ""farmworker""
or a ""labour tenant""? And, secondly who bears the onus of proving whether the
status in question is that of farmworker or labour tenant?
[23] As regards the relevant time or period that must determine whether a tenant
is a labour tenant as defined in the Act, and thus not a farmworker, several
options were debated in this Court. (It should be noted that the amendments to
sections 2 (5) and (6) of the Act in 1997 are not applicable to the present
appeals.)
On behalf of the Appellants it was initially argued that the relevant time is the
moment when the juristic act of eviction is initiated by the owner of the land. It is
at this moment that one has to establish whether the Appellants are or are not
protected by the Act. It was submitted by the Appellants that the definition of a
""farmworker"" is phrased in the present tense, and that the legislature’s intention
was that the question whether a person is a farm worker must be investigated with
regard to his status at the time when the matter comes before Court as a result of
an attempted eviction. The LCC (so it was argued) correctly held the following in
Zulu & Others vs Van Rensburg, supra, at page 1258 G :
It should also be noted that the definition is framed in the present tense (a person
who is), unlike certain aspects of the definition of labour tenant. This would
seem to suggest that the test must be applied in relation to the factual situation at
the time of the events immediately giving rise to the dispute. On this basis, if
respondents’ contention is correct that there are at present no agreements
regulating the applicants’ occupation of the farm, they would also not qualify as
farm workers.
It was common cause that the Appellants’ contracts of employment were
terminated during November 1994 (except that of the first Appellant who

retired during about 1991), long before the matter came before Court. The
Appellants were thus not farmworkers. As regards this aspect, therefore, it was
argued on behalf of the Appellants that the use of the present tense in the
definition of ""farmworker"" was significant. Whereas the question of whether a
person complies with the requirements of the definition of a""labour tenant"" is
answered with reference to the history of his residence on a property, the question
of whether he is a ""farmworker"" must be investigated with regard to his status at
the time when the matter comes before the court.
[24] To conclude as the Appellants do that the relevant time is the present (i.e.
when the present litigation was initiated) can have unexpected, even absurd
results.
Consider, for example, the case where a person has for his or her working life
provided labour to a landowner, and has enjoyed rights of residence and of
cropping and grazing, and yet has been remunerated predominantly in cash. In
formal terms he or she would be a ""farmworker"". Should such a person now retire
and, as happens frequently, be allowed by the landowner to remain on the farm
with the continuing right to cropping and grazing, and in exchange provide labour
in the form of ""light"" work such as housekeeping, herding, helping with dipping
and dosing cattle, supervising younger employees and caretaking, he or she would
now formally no longer be a ""farmworker"". If the definition of ""farmworker"" is
taken in the present tense only and refers to the moment of the attempted
termination of his occupancy, such a tenant as that being described could, if
threatened with eviction, conceivably claim the right to remain on the land as a
""labour tenant"". This would be consistent with paragraph (b), and would seem
just and equitable. On the other hand, if one were to extend the definition of
""farmworker"" into the past (i.e. to paragraphs (b) and (c)), the tenant, being then a
""farmworker"", would not qualify for occupancy as a ""labour tenant"" and would be
subject to eviction. So whimsical a result is patently unjust and could not have
been contemplated by the legislature, the more so if the preamble of the Act is
kept in mind.
Or, to take another example : The person in question resides on a farm and has
the right to use cropping or grazing land on the farm, but is also paid a salary in
cash. In good years, his or her rights to use cropping or grazing are more valuable
than the salary he or she receives, but in bad years of drought, the converse is
true. One can thus say that at some times in the past he or she was a farmworker,
if the definition is to be applied to a past state of affairs. To contend that a person
who complies with the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), but who was in
the past intermittently and through no choice of his or hers a ""farmworker"", is not
protected by the Act, is not acceptable.
Or take the case of one who has been a labour tenant for many years. Shortly

before his or her eviction the owner of the land raises the remuneration to such an
extent that the tenant is now clearly a farmworker. Is it fair to accept that he or
she cannot legally resist eviction?
For these reasons, the present time cannot be the relevant time for establishing
whether the occupier was a farmworker or not.
[25] In some cases it was held that the relevant moment is 2 June 1995 (see
Meskin J in Tselentis at 417 H-J; Hurt J in Salimba a quo; Van Dijkhorst J in
Mosehla v Sancor cc at 621 A-F). In these cases, reliance was placed on section
12 (1) of the Act. Section 12 of the Act, however, deals with the reinstatement of
labour tenants who, at that date, would have met the requirements of this Act had
it been in force, and who, between that date and 22 March 1996, the date of the
commencement of the Act, had vacated the farm or had been for any reason by
any process evicted. Read in this context, the provisions of section 12 are not
applicable to cases, such as the present, where it is not alleged that the occupiers
have, between 2 June 1995 and 22 March 1996, vacated the land or been evicted
therefrom. The date 2 June 1995 is, therefore, in the present context inappropriate
as a time for establishing whether the present occupiers are labour tenants or
farmworkers for purposes of the Act. It obviously could never have been the
intention of the Legislature to exclude from the protection of the Act anyone who
has, since 2 June 1995, become a labour tenant as defined in the Act.
[26] In my view, the only way to make sense of the confusion reigning in this
area is to conclude that the proviso relating to ""farmworker"" cannot, for the
reasons advanced above, refer only to the present time. It must refer to the whole
period in respect of which the present occupier, whose occupation is under
attack, has been occupying the land in question. The proviso relating to
farmworker applies not only to paragraph (a), but also to (b), which also refers to
the past.
[27] If one approaches the definition in this holistic or continuous sense, it
follows that what has to be established is the predominant quality of occupation
over the whole period during which the present occupier has been complying with
paragraphs (a) and (b). It may be, as illustrated above, that in respect of some
periods, the remuneration paid to the occupier in cash or some other form of
remuneration (see paragraph (a) of the definition of farmworker) may have
exceeded the value of the right to occupy and use the land; and vice versa. What
we have to find is the overall sense and value of the occupation. The present time
is but one moment in this continuum.
[28] The final question then takes this form : who bears the onus to prove or

disprove the overall sense and value of the occupation?
Interesting as this question may be, it is not necessary to decide the issue in this
appeal. For, assuming that the onus is on the Appellants, they have succeeded on
a balance of probabilities in proving that they were not farmworkers at the
relevant time.
There is an admitted paucity of evidence relating to the value of the rights to
residence, grazing and cultivating the land in question, and to the value of the
remuneration paid to the Appellants whether in cash or in specie. But what is
clear is that the Appellants and their forebears had for many years received the
absolute minimum in the form of remuneration for their services. It must be
overwhelmingly clear that the value of residence, grazing, cultivation and of
having a hearth and home of their own, a place where they could find the
fundamental security of living and surviving off the land, must have far
outweighed the benefits they received as remuneration in cash or in kind.
[29] There is a further basis on the evidence for finding that the Appellants were
not farm workers.
During the cross-examination of Craig Stone, the sole member of Salimba,
counsel for the Appellants asked him whether it was the practise throughout the
area that people who live on farms must work there. He agreed and explained that
if the tenant could not perform the work himself,
... there must be either a son or if all the sons are living on the farm than they
must come and work there or all the daughters are living on a farm they must
come and work there.
It is clear from this evidence that the appellants were not obliged to perform their
services personally. It follows that the contract between Salimba and the
Appellants did not contain a provision such as is referred to in paragraph (b) of
the definition of ""farmworker"" with the result that the Appellants were not
farmworkers as defined.
[30] In the result, I find that the first and third Appellants in the Salimba appeal
have proved that they were ""labour tenants"" and are entitled to the protection of
the Act.
[31] The following orders are made :
A In the appeal of Zwelake Ngcobo and Others v Salimba cc (case
no 50/98) :
(i) The appeal of the second and fourth Appellants is dismissed with
costs.

(ii) The appeal of the first and third Appellants succeeds with costs
including the costs attendant upon the employment of two counsel
and in their case the judgment of the court a quo is set aside and
replaced by the following order : ""Plaintiff’s claim is dismissed with
costs"".
B In the appeal of Fikile Ngcobo v Van Rensburg (case no 631/97)
the following order is made :
The appeal is dismissed with costs.

JUDGMENT

MELUNSKY AJA/

MELUNSKY AJA:
[1] 
The appellant is a company carrying on business as a
manufacturer in the engineering field.  The respondent is the National
Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (""NUMSA""), a trade union
registered under the Labour Relations Act 28 of 1956 (""the LRA"").  This
appeal concerns the appellant's dismissal of nineteen employees during
August 1992 following their participation in a national strike in the steel
and engineering industry and their failure to comply strictly with the
appellant's ultimatum that they return to work or face dismissal.  All of
the employees were members of NUMSA.  In terms of s 46(9) of the
LRA, NUMSA, on its own behalf and on behalf of the dismissed
employees, applied to the industrial court for an order declaring that the
dismissals constituted an unfair labour practice,  payment of
compensation to the employees and their reinstatement.  The application

was opposed by the appellant.  After a lengthy hearing the court
determined that the dismissals did not constitute an unfair labour
practice.  The determination was reversed on appeal to the Labour
Appeal Court (""the LAC"") on 6 December 1995.  It was the unanimous
view of the LAC (Nugent J and assessors) that the dismissals constituted
an unfair labour practice.  That court accordingly set aside the industrial
court's determination, ordered the appellant to reinstate the dismissed
employees with effect from 29 January 1996 (subject to certain
conditions) and directed it to pay each dismissed worker as compensation
an amount equivalent to his weekly wage at the date of his dismissal
multiplied by twenty-six.
[2] 
This appeal is one of a number of cases to come before the
courts as a result of the August 1992 national strike.  The strike followed
the collapse of annual wage negotiations which commenced at the

National Industrial Council for the Iron, Steel, Engineering and
Metallurgical Industries, a national collective bargaining forum.  The
parties to the negotiations included NUMSA, other trade unions and the
Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa (""SEIFSA""),
a body representing various employers' organisations.  The appellant is a
member of an employers' organisation which in turn was represented by
SEIFSA at the negotiations.  On 14 May 1992 deadlock was arrived at
between the trade union parties to the Industrial Council, including
NUMSA, and the employer organisations, represented by SEIFSA,
concerning the terms and conditions of employment in the industry.  The
dispute was referred to the Industrial Council but it remained unresolved.
[3] 
As a result NUMSA, through a committee known as the
National Strike Committee (""NSC""), called for a national strike of all of
its members after holding a strike ballot.  The strike commenced on 3

August 1992.  Twenty-five of the appellant's hourly-paid employees, all
members of NUMSA, joined the strike during the afternoon of 19
August.  On 25 August, and pursuant to an application brought by
SEIFSA and other applicants in the Supreme Court (Transvaal Provincial
Division), Myburgh J held that it had been prima facie established that a
number of irregularities had occurred in the holding of the strike ballot
and that the provisions of ss 65(2)(b) and 8(6)(b) of the LRA had not
been complied with.  As a result he issued an interim interdict restraining
NUMSA from calling for or taking part in the strike (Steel and
Engineering Industries Federation and Others v National Union of
Metalworkers of South Africa (2) 1993(4) SA 196 (T) ).
[4] 
On 26 August the appellant distributed a memorandum to its
striking workers calling upon them to return to work by 7 am on 28

August, failing which their services would be terminated.  On the
following day it fixed a notice headed ""Final Ultimatum"" to its main gate
requiring the striking employees to return to ""normal working by 7 am,
Friday 28 August 1992"".  The employees were advised, in terms of the
ultimatum, that those workers who failed to comply would be summarily
dismissed.  Only twelve striking workers arrived at work by the
stipulated time on 28 August.  The appellant considered that the
remaining thirteen employees had been dismissed and one of  those who
arrived at about 8.30 or 9 am, Mr Amon Madi, was so informed by the
appellant's factory manager, Mr Alastair Ian Wildman (""A I Wildman"").
The employees who had returned to work asked A I Wildman whether
two of their number would be permitted to attend a meeting that was due
to be held later that day at Hunter's Field Stadium.  The purpose of the
meeting was to obtain advice and consider a recommendation of the NSC

that the strike be called off and that all striking workers resume
employment on Monday 31 August.  Wildman refused permission for
any of the employees to go to the meeting but six of them decided to
attend and they did so.  They, too, were regarded by the appellant as
having been dismissed.  On 31 August all of the employees reported for
work but the nineteen who did not work on the previous Friday were
informed that they had been dismissed.  This resulted in the proceedings
in the industrial court and the subsequent appeal to the LAC.  The main
question for consideration  in this appeal is whether the dismissals
constituted an unfair labour practice. A secondary issue, raised in the
appellant's heads of argument, was whether the order for reinstatement
was appropriate and equitable.
[5] 
Before dealing with counsels' submissions it is desirable to
have regard to certain factors that had a bearing on the LAC's judgment.

The first concerns the strike.  Counsel for the respondent did not question
the correctness of the judgment of Myburgh J.  For his part, counsel for
the appellant did not challenge the LAC's finding that the striking
workers bona fide believed the strike to be lawful until they were made
aware of Myburgh J's decision on or shortly after 25August.
[6] 
A second matter that should be mentioned concerns two
telephone calls that Mr Lucky Skosana, the local NUMSA branch
chairman, made to A I Wildman.  Two of the striking workers, Mr Jack
Ngozo and Mr Paulus Mbango, consulted Skosana on the morning of 27
August in connection with the appellant's memorandum of the previous
day.  Skosana telephoned A I Wildman in the morning and again in the
afternoon of 27 August with a view to obtaining an extension of the
deadline for the employees' return to work until Monday 31 August.

Skosana was not available to give evidence but Ngoza was in his
presence when both telephone calls were made and he testified about
Skosana's requests and Wildman's responses as conveyed to him by
Skosana.  There are disputes between Ngoza and Wildman as to what
was said on each occasion.  All of these were not resolved by the LAC
but the industrial court dealt with the conflicting versions on the basis
that NUMSA had an ""evidentiary burden"" to establish its version of the
disputed issues on a balance of probabilities.  It is not necessary, in the
circumstances of this case, to consider whether the industrial court's
approach was the correct one.  Nor is it necessary to attempt to resolve
all of the matters in dispute.   What is significant is the findings made by
the LAC, which are generally binding on this Court - see National Union
of Metalworkers of South Africa v Vetsak Co-operative Limited and
Others 1996(4) SA 577 (A) at 583I-584A.  One of these findings was

that A I Wildman refused to extend the deadline to 31 August without
asking the reason for the request.  A further factual finding was that
during the course of the second telephone conversation Skosana said that
the workers would return to work the following morning (28 August) but
asked that at least some of them be allowed to attend the meeting at
Hunter's Field Stadium to consider the recommendation of the NSC.
Wildman responded that Skosana's request would be discussed when
they returned.
[7] 
NUMSA's response to the interdict issued by Myburgh J is
not in dispute.  A meeting of the NSC had previously been arranged for
Thursday 27 August.  After NUMSA received the news of the interdict
during the afternoon of Tuesday 25 August, consideration was given to
advancing the NSC meeting to the following day but it was decided that
it was not practical to do so.  At the meeting of 27 August the NSC

decided to recommend to NUMSA members that they return to work on
Monday 31 August.  The recommendations of the NSC were debated and
adopted by local NUMSA structures on Friday 28 August and
subsequent days.  This led to approximately 80 000 to a 100 000 workers
returning to their employment on 31 August and all, save for about 2
000, including the nineteen employees of the appellant, were accepted
back by their employers.
[8] 
It is clear from the evidence of A I Wildman and his brother
Mr Nigel Wildman (the appellant's managing director) that the appellant
had decided to dismiss all workers who did not strictly comply with the
ultimatum, a decision that was taken even before the ultimatum was
issued.  What is more the appellant was not prepared to accept any
excuse for non-compliance on the part of its employees or to consider
any extension of the deadline.  Indeed, according to A I Wildman's

evidence (which was accepted on this point by the LAC), he refused
Skosana's request for an extension out of hand and without knowing why
it was required.
[9] 
What was the appellant's motivation in adopting such an
uncompromising stand?  The reasons given for the appellant's refusal to
extend the date fixed for the return are similar to those given for its
refusal to accept the employees back on 31 August, namely, that the
workers went on strike without notice, that they defied the court's order
which declared the strike to be illegal, that the employees were therefore
unreliable and that the appellant wanted a ""disciplined"" and not an
unreliable workforce.  Nigel Wildman put it in the following terms:
""I decided that I wanted to have a stable reliable workforce.  These
people had gone on strike without notifying anybody about it as
to why.  They had given us no forewarning.  They defied the
Supreme Court order.  They defied our memorandums and
ultimatums to them.  A deadline to me is a deadline and I had

given more than fair warning and I thought that in the event that
they don't comply with this deadline, then I am going to seek out a
reliable workforce. In the longer term, it will - it would be a better
bet for the company.""

When asked in what sense were the striking workers not a reliable and
stable workforce, Nigel Wildman responded:
""Well, they were on strike when they should have been back at
work.""

[10] There is no doubt  that the appellant was severely affected
by the strike.  There was a recession in the industry at the time.  Even
before the strike the appellant was having difficulty in obtaining orders
and it  had been obliged to adopt various measures to ensure its
continued viability.  It was a comparatively small company and
production came to a virtual standstill with the strike of twenty-six of its
thirty-three hourly- paid workers.  The manner in which it conducted
business, which was not to retain large stocks on hand, rendered it

particularly vulnerable to strikes.  The result was that it lost orders and
was unable to complete a large contract timeously which led to the loss
of a valuable customer.  In order to overcome the difficulties, it
commenced employing casual workers to replace the strikers during the
week commencing 24 August.  In all it eventually engaged about ten
other workers who, in due course, replaced the striking employees as a
permanent work force.  The replacement workers were, however,
inexperienced and unskilled and it was only after about three weeks of
training that they were able to perform work to the same standard as that
previously performed by the dismissed employees.
[11] The approach to be adopted by this Court in dealing with an
appeal from a labour appeal court is to determine whether, on the facts
found by it, the court a quo made the correct decision and order (see

Slagment (Pty) Ltd v Building, Construction and Allied Workers' Union
1995(1) SA 742 (A) at 751I-J).  With that in mind I turn to consider the
rationale behind the LAC's decision and order.  That court held that the
illegality of the strike was, in the circumstances of this case, not a factor
of great significance as the employees concerned believed that all the
correct procedures had been followed and that the strike was not
prohibited.  Although the position changed after Myburgh J's ruling, the
LAC considered that ""any reasonable employer in this country"" would
have appreciated that his employees would look to their union for
guidance on the implications of the court order before returning to work
and that this is precisely what occurred in the instant case. Therefore the
appellant should not necessarily have expected an immediate return to
work.  The LAC assumed, however, that while the appellant might have
been justified in issuing the ultimatum when it did, it was not justified in

adopting an inflexible attitude thereafter; that it should have been aware
that Skosana sought to extend the deadline to enable employees to
consider whether to heed the recommendation to return to work; and that
the meeting at Hunter's Field Stadium on Friday 28 August had been
called for that purpose.  In the result, the LAC held that the appellant
should have awaited the outcome of the meeting before implementing the
ultimatum.  On that ground the dismissals constituted an unfair labour
practice.
[12] In this Court counsel for the appellant accepted that the
fairness of the ultimatum and the fairness of the dismissal had to be
judged separately.  As far as the former was concerned, he argued that
the appellant was justified in requiring the employees to return to work
on 28 August having regard to the appellant's desperate financial plight,
the sudden withdrawal of labour by the strikers and the fact that the

strike had been declared illegal.  On the facts of this case these arguments
may not be as compelling as they appear to be, viewed in the light of a
nation-wide strike, ongoing contact between NUMSA and SEIFSA and
the prospect, after Myburgh J's judgment, that NUMSA might try to
oversee an orderly return to work within a reasonable time.  Nevertheless
I will assume, as the LAC did, that the ultimatum was fair at the time
when it was issued.  It should be added that there is no suggestion that
the ultimatum was not understood or that it did not come to the attention
of the employees concerned.  Nor did NUMSA contend that the
employees had insufficient time to consider the implications of the
ultimatum or to comply with its terms.
[13] The crucial question is whether the dismissals pursuant to a
fair ultimatum were also fair.  In the Vetsak case, Smalberger JA
observed at 589D:

""In my view, it would be unwise and undesirable to lay down, or
to attempt to lay down, any universally applicable test for deciding
what is fair.""

Fairness is indeed an elusive concept in the context in which it is used in
unfair dismissal cases: but conduct that is unfair can often be recognised
when it is sought to apply the concept to the facts of the case.  On the
appellant's behalf it was submitted that the test of fairness had to be
judged in relation to the employees' failure to comply with the ultimatum
and that the LAC had erred in focussing the enquiry on whether the
appellant should have extended the ultimatum to 31 August.  This
submission seems to lose sight of the need to consider fairness from the
viewpoint of both parties to a dispute, a matter which is fundamental in
seeking to achieve one of the objectives of the LRA - the preservation of
labour peace (see the Vetsak case at 593G-I).
[14] The appellant's counsel placed particular stress on Skosana's

statement to A I Wildman that the employees would return to work on 28
August in compliance with the ultimatum.  This, it was argued, amounted
to an undertaking on which the appellant was entitled to rely.  It was
therefore reasonable for the employer to expect that the workers would
resume employment on the morning of 28 August and their failure to do
so entitled the appellant to dismiss them.  Consequently, and according to
the argument, there was no need for the appellant to have allowed the
employees an extension until 31 August for their return to work.  In any
event there was, at the time, no certainty that the employees would return
on 31 August.  The appellant, it was submitted, was justified in deciding
to tolerate no further disruption to its business.
[15] Before considering the validity of these arguments, some of
the matters raised require clarification.  The first is that A I Wildman
testified that not only did Skosana tell him that the workers would be

returning on the Friday but that he (Skosana) had already contacted them
in that regard.  Ngoza denied this.  He said that he made contact with
some of the workers only later that evening, an account which seems to
accord with the probabilities, as it is unlikely that Skosana would have
told the workers to resume employment on the following day while he
was still attempting to obtain an extension of the deadline.  Although the
LAC made no specific finding on which version was to be preferred, it
referred to Ngoza's account with apparent approval and it is reasonable to
assume that his account was accepted by the court a quo.
[16] A second aspect, and perhaps a more important one, is that
Skosana did not give A I Wildman an unqualified assurance that all of
the workers would report for duty in terms of the ultimatum as he asked
Wildman to release some of them to attend the meeting.  Wildman's
response, that the matter would be discussed on the following morning,

confirms that there remained a matter which still required some
negotiation.  There is a dispute between Ngoza and Wildman on
precisely what occurred on the morning of 28 August.  What is clear,
however, is that Wildman refused permission for any employees to
attend the meeting without, it seems, any further negotiation or even
discussion.
[17] On Thursday evening, Dr Fanaroff, who was then
NUMSA's national secretary, appeared on the national television on the 8
pm news and relayed the NSC's recommendation that all employees
should return to work on 31 August.  This recommendation was also
widely reported in the print media on the following morning.  A I
Wildman conceded that he was aware of the NSC's recommendation on
the evening of 27 August.  Moreover the LAC held that on the Friday
morning ""he must ... have been aware"" that the purpose of the meeting at

Hunter's Field Stadium was to consider the recommendation and that that
was the reason why Skosana asked him, on the previous day, to extend
the deadline.  It should have been obvious to the appellant on Thursday
27 August that there was a reasonable likelihood that the striking
employees would return to work on the following Monday.  In fact
nineteen did return on that day and it was then that at least twelve of
them were told of their dismissals for the first time.
[18] The appellant's factory was closed over the weekend and
what has to be decided, therefore, is whether, on the facts of this case, the
appellant should have stayed its hand for one day.  It must be emphasized
that a dismissal will not necessarily be fair merely because a fair
ultimatum is not complied with.  Dismissal is a drastic step and, as has so
often been said, a ""course of last resort"" (see National Union of

Mineworkers and Others v Free State Consolidated Gold Mine
(Operations) Ltd - President Steyn Mine; President Brand Mine;
Freddies Mine 1996(1) SA 422 (A) at 448H-I).  It is for this reason that
an employer, before implementing an ultimatum, should give careful
consideration, inter alia, to new facts that may have arisen or
circumstances that may have developed since the issue of the ultimatum.
It should also consider how the employees responded to the call to
return to work.  The need for an employer to act with a measure of
restraint may even be more important in  the case of mass dismissals
where the job security of a large number of workers may be at stake.
[19] The appellant's attitude in this case was inflexible and
intransigent.  It did not even consider extending the deadline, despite
significant facts that had occurred since the ultimatum was issued,
namely, that NUMSA (through the NSC) had recommended a return to

work on 31 August, that local structures were to consider this and that
the meeting at Hunter's Field Stadium on 28 August was called to discuss
this very recommendation.  The appellant had decided, when the
ultimatum was issued, that the deadline was ""cast in stone"", to employ
the expression used by both A I and Nigel Wildman and that any
employee who failed to comply with it would be dismissed. This rigid
approach was exemplified in the summary dismissal of Amon Madi on
28 August.  It would seem that the appellant did not even ask the reason
for Madi's late arrival at work before dismissing him.
[20] As a result of the intractable attitude adopted by the
appellant, the failure to comply with the ultimatum inexorably led to
dismissals.  The appellant had closed its mind to the developments that
had taken place since the ultimatum was issued.  It was not prepared,
under any circumstances, to postpone the time for the return to work.  As

Nigel Wildman put it: ""come what may, we wouldn't extend the
deadline"".  In the circumstances of this matter there were no compelling
reasons why the appellant could not have held back for one working day
and its refusal to do so was not based on rational grounds.  On the
contrary it insisted on the deadline with the apparent purpose of ensuring
that it would have a pliant workforce in the future.  This was not a fair
way of dealing with a labour dispute.  It therefore follows that the LAC's
decision on this point should be upheld.
[21] Although it was contended in the appellant's heads of
argument that the court a quo should not have ordered a reinstatement of
the dismissed employees, this aspect, quite correctly, was not seriously
pursued at the hearing of the appeal.  There is no reason, therefore, for us
to interfere with any part of the order of the LAC save to add a paragraph
to make provision for a deduction from the amounts payable to the

employees of  remuneration earned by them through employment from
the date of their dismissal until the date on which they might
recommence employment with the appellant.  This provision was agreed
upon and formulated by both counsel and we are grateful to them for
doing so.
[22] The question of costs remains.  In the appeal of National
Union of Metalworkers of South Africa v G M Vincent Metals Sections
(Pty) Ltd (case 116/96), I drew attention to the fact that many irrelevant
documents had been included in the record on appeal.  In this matter, too,
the record was unnecessarily burdened with a great deal of material that
was entirely unnecessary.  The explanation given by counsel for the
inclusion of these documents was the same as that put forward in the
Vincent case, namely that the parties had made a bona fide attempt to
reach agreement on the record but had been unsuccessful in doing so.

Although this explanation will be accepted for the purposes of the
present appeal, it is necessary to emphasize that it is not sufficient for the
attorneys for the parties  merely to attempt to reach agreement on what
parts of the record should be excluded.  It is likely that instances similar
to this will, in the future, be viewed in a more serious light and the
offending parties, or their attorneys, will be subjected to punitive costs
awards.
[23] Counsel for NUMSA requested the costs of two counsel to
the extent that two counsel had been employed for the purposes of the
appeal.  NUMSA decided, reasonably enough, that one counsel would
suffice for the purpose of arguing the appeal and there seems to be no
reason why two counsel were required for any preliminary stages.
[24] In the result it is ordered:
(1)
The appeal is dismissed with costs;

(2)
The date 12 April 1999 will be substituted for the date 12 January
1996 in paragraph 3 of the order of the LAC and the date 3 May
1999 will be substituted for the date 29 January 1996 in
paragraphs 3, 5 and 7 of the said order.
(3)
The order of the LAC is amended by the inclusion of the
following paragraph:
""10.1 Any amounts owing by the respondent to the individual
workers pursuant to this order of retrospective
reinstatement will be subject to deduction therefrom of all
remuneration that has been earned by such  worker through
employment from the date of dismissal until the date of
recommencement of employment with the respondent in
terms of this order.

10.2 In the event of a dispute arising between the parties
concerning whether, and if so what amount of remuneration
has been earned by any worker during the applicable
period, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration under
the auspices of the Independent Mediation Service of South
Africa (<IMMSA') in terms of the Arbitration Act 42 of
1965 for a determination of the amount of remuneration
earned during the period in question by the worker

concerned.

10.3 In the event of submission of the aforesaid dispute to
arbitration, the parties will attempt to agree upon the
arbitrator and the formulation of the arbitrator's terms of
reference.

10.4 Should the parties fail to reach agreement upon the
arbitrator then the director of IMMSA shall appoint an
arbitrator on the parties' behalf.""

JUDGMENT
MELUNSKY AJA/

MELUNSKY AJA:
[1] The respondent was arrested as long ago as 21 December
1995 in connection with his alleged involvement in two offences, namely,
certain unlawful gold transactions and housebreaking with intent to steal
and theft.  On the day of his arrest he brought an application for his
release on bail.  This was opposed by the State and was heard by the
regional magistrate of Welkom during the night of 21 to 22 December.
After hearing oral evidence the magistrate refused to grant the application
and the respondent was detained in custody.
[2] The respondent noted an appeal to the Orange Free State
Provincial Division of the Supreme Court, as it was then called.  He also
applied for the appeal to be heard as a matter of urgency.  On 30
December 1995 the application came before Lichtenberg JP, who was
then the duty judge.  The court was in recess at the time.  According to the

practice in that division bail appeals were ordinarily heard by two judges
during term but the duty judge was entitled to hear such an appeal during
recess if he regarded the matter as sufficiently urgent.  The learned judge
president did not consider that the matter was urgent enough to warrant
a hearing before a single judge and he made an order in chambers
directing, inter alia, that the appeal be placed on the roll for a hearing
before a full court on a date to be arranged.
[3] Two days later, on 1 January 1996, and while the Provincial
Division was still in recess, the respondent renewed his application for the
appeal to be heard on an urgent basis, relying on certain further facts
which were placed before the court on affidavit.  The duty judge was then
Edeling J. He was of the view that the order of Lichtenberg JP did not
preclude him from hearing the appeal during recess if the circumstances
justified it.  Despite opposition by the attorney-general, Edeling J

regarded the additional facts as sufficiently cogent to warrant his hearing
the appeal as a matter of urgency and he granted an order to this effect.
He then proceeded to hear the appeal and, on the same day, ordered that
the respondent be released on bail of R5 000, subject to certain conditions
which do not require to be detailed.
[4] On 10 January 1996 the appellant applied for leave to appeal
to this Court against the orders of the court a quo.  On 12 January Edeling
J postponed the application sine die.  It was eventually heard on 12 April
when, after argument, judgment was reserved.  In a lengthy judgment
delivered on 25 July 1996 the learned judge granted the appellant leave
to appeal.  The appeal eventually came before this Court on 15 March
1999, more than three years after the respondent's release on bail.  As a
result of the long delay and the possibility that subsequent events might
have rendered this appeal of academic interest only, counsel were

requested to submit additional heads of argument on whether the judgment
of this Court would have any practical effect or result.  From the
information put before us by counsel it appears that after the respondent's
release on bail on or about 1 January 1996 he appeared before the
regional court at Virginia on numerous occasions for the purposes of his
criminal trial.  We were informed that he appeared on ninety-three
separate days in all.  The leading of evidence in the trial has been
completed and the matter has now been postponed to 19 April 1999 for
the purposes of argument.  The appellant accepts that the respondent has
complied with all of the conditions which governed his release on bail.
[5] On appeal to this Court counsel submitted argument in limine
on whether, if the appellant is successful, this Court's judgment would
have any practical result or effect.  Judgment was reserved on this aspect
of the case without argument being addressed to us on the merits of the

appeal.  It may be noted that since the judgment of the court a quo certain
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 relating to bail,
which were extensively dealt with in the judgment on leave to appeal,
have been substantially amended by the Criminal Procedure Second
Amendment Act 85 of 1997.   However, and for reasons which will
become apparent, it is not necessary to deal with the effect of the
amendments or with the merits of the appeal.
[6] It was conceded by the appellant that if the appeal is
successful and a warrant  issued for the respondent's arrest, he would,  as
a matter of strong probability, be released on bail again, pursuant to a
fresh application.  This result would follow due to his observance of all
of the conditions of bail since 1 January 1996.  Indeed, counsel for the
appellant went so far as to state that an application for the respondent's
release on bail would probably not be opposed by the State.  Should the

appeal succeed, therefore, it will serve no  purpose other than to involve
the respondent in inconvenience and additional legal costs and to increase
the workload of the court that is called upon to hear the application for his
release on bail.  For this reason the appeal will not have any practical
effect or result.  What has to be considered, however, is whether it is
permissible for this Court to have regard to facts and circumstances that
have arisen since the respondent's release on bail.  If these may properly
be taken into account, the appeal should fail.
[7] Counsel for the respondent, relying on S v Maki en Andere
(1) 1994(2) SACR 630 (E) and S v Ndjadayi 1995(2) SACR 583 (E),
submitted that the application for the respondent's release on bail was a
civil proceeding for the purposes of the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959.
He argued, therefore, that in terms of s 21A(1) of that Act it was
competent for this Court to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that it

would have no practical effect or result.  The section, which was recently
applied and explained in this Court in Premier, Provinsie Mpumalanga
en <n Ander v Groblersdalse Stadsraad 1998(2) SA 1136 (SCA) reads:
""(1)
When at the hearing of any civil appeal to the Appellate
Division or any Provincial or Local Division of the Supreme
Court the issues are of such a nature that the judgment or
order sought will have no practical effect or result, the
appeal may be dismissed on this ground alone.""
A ""civil appeal"" in terms of the section would presumably be an appeal in
""civil proceedings"" (see s 20(1) of the Supreme Court Act and the
marginal note to s 21A).  In this appeal, however, it is not necessary to
decide whether an application for bail is a civil proceeding. Nor is it
necessary to pronounce upon the correctness of the views expressed in
S  v Maki en Andere  and S v Ndjadayi  and I refrain from doing so.  The
fact is that the appellant's appeal to this Court is not brought in terms of
s 20 or, indeed, in terms of s 21 of the Supreme Court Act.  It is

authorised and regulated by a special provision, namely, s 65(A)(2) of the
Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977.  Section 65A was introduced by s 7
of the Criminal Procedure Second Amendment Act 75 of 1995 which
came into operation on 21 September 1995.  Section 65(A)(2) of the
Criminal Procedure Act reads:
""(2)
(a)
The attorney-general may appeal to the Appellate
Division against the decision of a superior court to
release an accused on bail.

(b)
The provisions of section 316 in respect of an
application or appeal referred to in that section by an
accused, shall apply mutatis mutandis with reference
to a case in which the attorney-general appeals in
terms of paragraph (a) of this sub-section.
(c)
Upon an appeal in terms of paragraph (a) or an
application referred to in paragraph (b) brought by an
attorney-general, the court may order that the State
pay the accused concerned the whole or any part of
the costs to which the accused may have been put in
opposing the appeal or application, taxed according
to the scale in civil cases of that court.""
M G Cowling suggests in South African Journal of Criminal Justice

(1996) Vol 9 at 59 that s 65A ""balances out the appellate procedure"" by
conferring upon an attorney-general the right of appeal which an accused
has always enjoyed.  There is, however, no need to consider whether,
prior to the introduction of s 65A of the Criminal Procedure Act, an
attorney-general had the right of appeal to this Court in terms of s 20 or
s 21 of the Supreme Court Act.  What is clear is that he cannot now
appeal in terms of that Act as the right of appeal is regulated solely by s
65A read with s 316 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  This being the case,
s 21A of the Supreme Court Act cannot be invoked by the respondent in
this appeal.
[8] The question that remains is whether this Court is
nevertheless entitled to have regard on appeal to events subsequent to the
judgment of the court a quo and, in consequence, to dismiss the appeal on
the ground that those facts disclose that there will be no practical benefit

to the appellant, should the appeal succeed.  It is not open to doubt that,
as a general rule, the correctness of a court's decision is to be decided
according to the facts in existence at the time it is given and not according
to new circumstances subsequently coming into existence (see Rex v
Verster 1952(2) SA 231(A) at 236).  The preliminary point arising in this
appeal, however, does not have any bearing on the correctness of the
judgment given in the court a quo.  What it raises is whether the
subsequent facts can be considered solely for the purpose of deciding that
the appeal, if successful, will result in no practical effect or result to the
appellant.  This Court has held that it is not obliged to give decisions on
academic questions that have no real bearing on the conviction or
acquittal of an accused (see Attorney-General, Transvaal v Flats Milling
Co (Pty) Ltd and Others 1958(3) SA 360 (A) at 370H-372D).  There is
no reason why  the same principle should not be extended to cover an

appeal relating to bail.  Indeed, in a sense, a decision on bail is an a
fortiori case because an accused person may, despite a court's refusal to
order his release on bail, renew the application from time to time should
the circumstances change (see S v Makola 1994(2) SACR 32 (A) at 35f-g;
S v Vermaas 1996(1) SACR 528 (T) at 531e-g).  It is necessary to
emphasize, however, that the parties to an appeal on bail should not, in
general, attempt to utilize the appeal procedure for the purpose of putting
new facts before the court.  The remedy of an accused person who wishes
to raise these facts is to do so before the court of first instance and not
before the court of appeal.  This seems to be a special case.  The
respondent was released on bail more than three years ago.  It is conceded
by the State that he would be entitled to be released again if this Court
had to allow the appeal and issue a warrant for his arrest. Counsel for the
attorney-general was in fact constrained to concede that no practical

benefit would accrue to the appellant if the merits of the appeal were
argued.  He submitted only that a decision on the merits may be used as
a precedent in other bail applications.  This submission merely reinforces
the view that the outcome of the appeal will not affect the rights of the
parties in a practical manner.
[9] It may be noted, moreover, that the considerable delay in the
matter being heard by this Court cannot be attributed to the respondent.
Regrettably, the initial delay was due to the judgment on leave to appeal
being delivered more than six months after the application was lodged.
The second reason was that inadequate steps seem to have been taken by
the appellant to request this Court to grant some preference for the hearing
of the appeal (see S v Makola (supra), admittedly a case dealing with an
appeal by an accused person, which was heard in this Court a little more
than a month after the judgment in the court a quo).

[10] For the reasons given I am of the view that this Court may,
in the circumstances of the present case, consider the facts that have
arisen since the release of the respondent on bail for the purpose of
deciding whether the appeal will have any practical effect or result.
Furthermore, it is proper to conclude, particularly in view of the
appellant's own concessions in this regard, that the appeal will not have
such a result.  It is only necessary to observe, of course, that no view is
expressed on the correctness of the decision of the court a quo.
[11] In the circumstances of this case the respondent's counsel did
not request this Court to make an award of costs in favour of his client.
The result is, therefore, that the point in limine is decided in favour of the

respondent and the appeal is dismissed.

Catnic v Hill.
JUDGMENT

PLEWMAN JA
This is an appeal against an order by Roux J, sitting as
Commissioner of Patents, in a matter concerning an alleged
infringement of a patent.  The appellants are the registered joint
proprietors of South African Letters Patent No 90/2427 in respect of an
invention entitled “Pressure Resistant Bag”.  They acquired this by an
assignment from the original patentees.  The respondent manufactures
and sells a competing product.  Appellants applied in the court a quo
on notice of motion for a permanent interdict restraining the respondent
from selling or offering its product for sale and for an order for the
delivery up of any infringing bags.  The Commissioner dismissed the
application with costs but granted leave to appeal to this Court.
The patent was granted with effect from 27 February 1991.  It
was applied for by appellants’ predecessors in title in March 1990,
claiming priority from three prior patent applications.  It seems,
however, that the respondent, too, had been active in the field for some
years.  The affidavits filed in support of the notice of motion are of a
somewhat perfunctory nature.  This may have had an influence on the
response thereto by the respondent.  There was (unusually for patent
litigation) no challenge to the validity of the patent.  In the result there
is on the record no evidence in which the prior art is discussed in any
depth.  Perhaps more importantly, there is not any evidence to show
that the patent, when viewed through the eyes of the skilled addressee,
should be read in any manner which would give the words of the claims
a meaning other than their primary meaning.  This is an aspect to which
I shall return.
In its commercial embodiment the patent takes the form of a bag

used in the support systems employed underground in mines.  Mine
support bags are fitted in or into packs of timber support in excavated
stopes or other underground working places.  The bags are filled under
pressure to wedge the timber supports into position.  There are two
systems in use.  In one system (known as the “weeping system”) the
bag is of a porous woven material and is filled with grout.  The water
in the grout passes through the bag while the solids remain behind and
set to provide solid support.  In the other system (the “non-weeping
system”) the bag is impervious to liquid and a chemically reactive mix
is pumped into the bag which hardens by chemical action to provide the
support.
The specification is (fortunately) not a technically complex
document.  The general description of the invention in the specification
reads:
“This invention relates to a flexible bag which is resistant
to damage from high internal pressure such as would be
caused by filling the bag to a high pressure with a liquid,
grout or the like and to damage caused by loads and/or
shock loads imposed on the outside of the bag when the
bag is filled with air or liquid under pressure.”
The consistory clause reads:
“A pressure resistant bag according to the invention
includes a first bag which is made from an air impervious
plastics material, an envelope which is made from a
reinforced flexible material and in which the first bag is
located, a second bag which is made from reinforced
flexible material in which the envelope is located and a
filler arrangement which is attached to the first bag and
passes through apertures in the envelope and second bag.
Conveniently, the first bag is made from an unseamed

tube of plastics material with the ends of the tube sealed
to provide a closed bag.
Further according to the invention the envelope is in the
form of an open ended tube in which the first bag is
located.  Preferably, however, the envelope is made from
a woven plastics material with the weft threads of the
weave conveniently being circumferential in the tube and
of a higher tensile strength than the warp threads.
In the preferred form of the invention the sealed ends of
the first bag are transverse to the tube axis of the envelope
and are located on the inside of and adjacent the open
ends of the envelope with the end portions of the envelope
together with the sealed end portions of the first bag being
folded back on to an outer surface of the tube with the
first bag and envelope being so located in the second
bag.”
In infringement proceedings one is concerned only with the
invention claimed.  The patent has twenty claims but what is in dispute
between the parties can be dealt with having regard only to the main
claim.  Indeed, only one integer is in dispute and in that regard it is, in
the main, the bearing one phrase has on the construction of that claim
that must be debated.  The claim may, for convenience, be set out as
having the following integers:
“(i)
A pressure resistant bag including
(ii)
A first bag which is made from an air impervious
plastics material
(iii)
An envelope which is made from a reinforced
flexible material and in which the first bag is
located
(iv)
A second bag which is made from a reinforced

flexible material in which the envelope is located
and
(v)
A filler arrangement which is attached to and opens
into the first bag and passes through apertures in
the envelope and second bag.”
It is integer (iv) that gives rise to the debate.
The respondent’s product is very similar to the patented product.
It is stated in the answering affidavits that respondent was engaged in
1989 in development work on, initially, weeping bags but later also on
non-weeping bags.  Tests conducted by it established that the pressures
applied to the non-weeping bags were of such an order that the bags
were unable to withstand the loading.  They required some form of
transverse securement.  What respondent’s witness says is that
respondent then attempted to provide this securement by putting the
bag into a restraining sleeve.  It was found that the bag when so
reinforced worked well and the sleeve assisted in restraining the
tendency of the folded over flaps of the bag to pull away and open the
bag up.  This had been a major problem.  What respondent
manufactured at relevant times was a bag reinforced in this manner -
that is by the  addition of a restraining sleeve to provide the necessary
resistance or strength.  It is common cause that respondent’s bag
exhibits the features of all the integers of the main claim - other than
integer (iv). It is asserted by respondent that its bag avoids the extra
material and labour required to form a second full bag around the
composite inner bag as in the patent.  It therefore does not contain
integer (iv) and, accordingly, does not infringe.

The first task of the court is to construe the claim.  When the
meaning of the claim has been determined the alleged infringing article
is to be compared therewith.  What must be shown is that all of the
features or limitations of the claim are present.  Appellants’ contention
is that respondent’s bag consists of a “bladder” of an impervious plastic
material (which is said to constitute the first bag of the claim), a
“casing” (which is said to constitute the envelope of the claim) and a
“sheath” (which is said to “correspond”to the second bag).  The case
then turns on a short point of construction namely whether the sleeve
of respondent’s bag is a second bag, as that expression is used in the
claims of the patent.
The correct approach to the interpretation of a patent
specification is a topic adverted to in almost every reported decision in
patent law.  But one need go no further than the careful examination of
the problem in Gentiruco A G v Firestone SA (Pty) Ltd 1972 (1) SA
589 (A) at 613D-618G.  Appellants’ counsel, however, sought to
invoke as an aid to the interpretation of the claim the principle known
as “purposive construction”.  For this reason a brief word must be said
with regard to that proposition.  The epithet laden term “purposive
construction” derives from Lord Diplock’s speech in Catnic
Components Limited and Another v Hill and Smith Limited [1982]
RPC 183 (H.L.).    It has been invoked in this Court in the field of
patent law inter alia in Multotec Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd v  Screenex
Wire Weaving Manufacturers (Pty) Ltd 1983 (1) SA 709 (A); Selas
Corporation of America v Electric Furnace Co 1983  (1) SA 1043 (A);
Stauffer Chemical Co & Another v Safsan Marketing and Distribution
Co (Pty) Ltd and Others 1987 (2) SA 331 (A) and Sappi Fine Papers

(Pty) Ltd v ICI Canada Inc 1992 (3) SA 306 (A).  The concept of a
purposive construction was used as an interpretive aid in these cases in
different ways.  In some it is employed as a phrase of general
application in the construction of claims connoting an approach based
upon the skilled addressee’s knowledge of the art (as opposed to a
purely verbal analysis).  In others (as for example in the Multotec case,
supra) it is invoked as an interpretive aid where the alleged infringer
was considered to have appropriated what has been called the “pith and
marrow” of the invention and merely substituted a mechanical
equivalent for an inessential part.  There is in fact no room for its
application in the present case but it is necessary to point out that in all
of the above cases the Court was concerned to establish whether the
particular features of the claimed invention taken by the alleged
infringer represented all the essential features of the claim.  This, in the
final analysis, remains a pure question of construction. In the Catnic
case Lord Diplock, after noting that a patent specification is “a
unilateral statement by a patentee in words of his own choosing”
addressed to persons skilled in the art went on to say (at 243):
“A patent specification should be given a purposive
construction rather than a purely literal one derived from
applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in
which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to
indulge.  The question in each case is: whether persons
with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of
work in which the invention was intended to be used,
would understand that strict compliance with a particular
descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was

intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of
the invention so that any variant would fall outside the
monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material
effect upon the way the invention worked.”
How this proposal is implemented is discussed below.  What should
first be noted is that in the Catnic case too the ultimate question was
one of construction.  This is explained in a careful analysis of Lord
Diplock’s test (in the Catnic case) by Hoffman J in Improver
Corporation and Others v Remington Consumer Products Limited and
Others FSR [1990] 181.  At p 189 the learned judge stated:
“In the end, therefore, the question is always whether the
alleged infringement is covered by the language of the
claim.  This, I think, is what Lord Diplock meant in
Catnic when he said that there was no dichotomy between
‘textual infringement’ and infringement of the ‘pith and
marrow’ of the patent and why I respectfully think that
Fox L.J. put the question with great precision in Anchor
Building Products Ltd. v. Redland Roof Tiles Ltd. when
he said the question was whether the absence of a feature
mentioned in the claim was ‘an immaterial variant which
a person skilled in the trade would have regarded as being
within the ambit of the language”.  (The emphasis is that
of Hoffman J.)
But there is another facet of Lord Diplock’s test to which
attention must be directed.  This is the role of s 125 of the English

Patents Act of 1977 and Article 69 of the European Patent Convention.
The convention was concluded in Munich in 1973.  England has
adhered to it.  Article 69 was an attempt to ensure a measure of
uniformity in the construction of patent specifications within the
European community by stipulating permissible readings of patent
claims (the Protocol).  The reason, in brief, lies in the difference
between the traditional approach to claim interpretation in United
Kingdom and the continental approach which rests largely on the views
of persons skilled in the particular art.  An article by B Sherman in
[1991] 54 Modern Law Review p 499 “Patent Claim Interpretation:
The Impact of the Protocol on Interpretation” is instructive in this
regard.  It seems as if the aim has not been wholly achieved.  What
Hoffmann J’s analysis showed is that Lord Diplock’s proposed test was
influenced by the Protocol.  See Hoffman J in the Improver case,
supra, at p 190 and Southco Inc and Another v Dzus Fastner Europe
Ltd [1990] RPC 587 at p 603 and 604.  Lord Diplock’s proposal is that
the court should ask itself three questions.  Two of these are questions
of fact dependent on extrinsic evidence.  To the extent to which this
could be understood to suggest that extrinsic evidence on interpretation
be led in all cases it would not be in accordance with our law.  It is
contrary to the judgment of this Court in the Gentiruco case.  See the
judgment of  Trollip JA at p 617A-618G.  In the cases in this Court in
which the concept of a purposive construction has been invoked this
has always been in a context which in no way detracted from the firmly
established principles of claim construction.  Generally, evidence on
record for other reasons, such as evidence to explain the art and science
in question to enable the court to view the patent “through the eyes of

the addressee”, allowed the court to adopt a purposive approach.  In
the Multotec case, for example, the claim in question was ambiguous
and the invocation of an aid to interpretation was appropriate.
What I have said has been prompted only by the need to point
out that it is not always open to a court to resort to evidence as an aid
to construction.  None of the South African authorities to which I have
referred (nor indeed the English cases other than the Improver
Corporation case  and the Southco case) have directed attention to the
effect of the Protocol in the Catnic case or to the factual nature of part
of the test.  In most cases a test which necessitates extrinsic evidence
will be inappropriate.  The caution sounded by Trollip JA in the
Gentiruco case at p 613 D-E about the use of English and American
decisions remains valid and apposite.  (I should add that Lord
Diplock’s approach has also been invoked in cases not concerning
patents.  An example is Public Carriers Association and Others v Toll
Road Concessionaries (Pty) Ltd and Others 1990 (1) SA 925 (A) at p
943 C-H - again a case where ambiguity was a problem.  But it is
beyond the scope of this judgment to discuss the application of the
Catnic test in decisions other than patent cases.)  What can be said is
that in patent cases the need for a practical construction is obviously
desirable.  But care is called for in the manner in which recourse may
be had to Lord Diplock’s test.
As I have said, the present case is a good example of
circumstances where it would be singularly inappropriate to attempt to
apply the Catnic procedure.  Counsel sought to do so both in the main
argument and in an alternative argument.  In his main argument he
addressed an argument, without evidence on the point, as to what the

“true” invention was.  In the alternative argument he sought to raise a
“pith and marrow” contention, again without any appropriate evidence
having been adduced.  The present patent in fact involves no technical
complexities and uses no esoteric phraseology.  The words of the claim
are ordinary English words clearly used in their ordinary connotation
and the claim is unambiguous.  There is therefore nothing which would
justify a reference either to phraseology in the body of the specification
or to extrinsic evidence relating to the art.  The claim in issue must
simply be read in its own terms.
No aid to interpretation (going any further than the need to read
the document as a whole) is called for.  In the consistory clause itself
there is discussion of the first bag being made of an unseamed tube
with ends sealed to provide a closed bag.  This statement is followed
by a description of the envelope being in the form of an open ended
tube.  The open ended member is thus accurately described as a tube
in contrast to a bag.  With that background one turns to the claim where
one encounters the word “bag” not only used in its ordinary sense but
also used in juxtaposition to the word envelope.  There is also a
reference to a first bag and a second bag.  The ordinary meaning of the
word bag according to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary is “a
receptacle of flexible material open only at the top (where it can be
closed)”. The word is unambiguous.  The patentee must therefore be
understood to have intended the limitation to the claim which follows
from the use of the words “second bag” to be given effect to.  The
respondent’s product does not have a second bag and therefore does
not infringe the claim.
The appeal is dismissed with costs including the costs of two

counsel.

JOAN VAN DER WESTHUIZEN RESPONDENT

BEFORE: VAN HEERDEN DCJ, HEFER, NIENABER, MARAIS and SCHUTZ JJA
HEARD: 7 MAY 1999
DELIVERED: 24 MAY 1999
Insolvency - claim by solvent spouse for return of asset deemed to fall into insolvent spouse’s
estate by s 21 of Insolvency Act - under common law collusive donation between spouses cannot
found a ""title valid as against creditors"" under s 21 (2) (c) - question not whether transaction a
donation but whether a collusive donation - simulation to be ignored - on facts collusion found.

SCHUTZ JA:
Section 21 (1) of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 (""the Act"") provides that upon the sequestration of
the separate estate of a spouse (""the insolvent"") all the property of the other spouse (""the solvent
spouse"") vests in the Master and thereafter in the trustee. The insolvent in this case is Hertzog
van der Westhuizen, whose estate was finally sequestrated at Cape Town on 2 February 1995.
The solvent spouse, to whom I shall refer as ""the wife"", is Joan van der Westhuizen, who was the
successful applicant before van Deventer J, and who is the respondent on appeal, leave having
been refused below and thereafter granted on petition. Her application was based on s 21 (2) of
the Act, which provides that the trustee shall release any property of the solvent spouse ""which is
proved"" by that spouse to have been acquired during the marriage ""by a title valid as against the
creditors of the insolvent"" (to quote the only one of the five classes of property listed in the
section that is relevant). The purpose of s 21 is to ""prevent or at least to hamper collusion
between spouses to the detriment of creditors of the insolvent spouse"" (as van Heerden JA put it
in De Villiers NO v Delta Cables (Pty) Ltd 1992 (1) SA 9 (A) at 13 I); and, viewed from the other
angle, ""to ensure that property which properly belonged to the insolvent ends up in the estate"" (as
Goldstone J put it in Harksen v Lane NO And Others 1998 (1) SA 300 (CC) at 318 E).
The van der Westhuizens were married out of community of property in 1957. She had been a
teacher and he a farmer in the Aberdeen district. Roundabout 1982 he purchased and had
transferred to himself a holiday home at Hartenbos near Mossel Bay (""the home""). In December

1989 he sold his farms and on 23 May 1990 he sold the home to his wife. Transfer was taken by
her on 25 September 1991. His estate was sequestrated in 1995. It was because of the refusal of
the appellant (Mrs Lyndall Beddy - the insolvent’s trustee - hereinafter ""the trustee"") to release the
home under s 21 (2) that the application by the wife was brought. The trustee’s stand is that the
known circumstances, plus the spouses’ backwordness in revealing facts best known to
themselves, throw serious doubt upon the genuineness of the sale, and give strong grounds for
suspicion that there was collusion between them to rescue the house out of his estate to the
prejudice of creditors.
An amendment to the insolvency legislation in 1926 is the basis of the decision in Maudley’s
Trustees v Maudsley 1940 TPD 399, to the effect that the onus had been shifted to the solvent
spouse to prove one of the grounds constituting entitlement to release under s 21 (2) and its
immediate 1926 predecessor. The parties are agreed that the onus rests on the wife to prove that
she acquired the home ""by a title valid as against the creditors of the insolvent"". But there was
some argument as to what the extent of this onus was, particularly whether the wife had to
disprove the applicability of sections 26 (dispositions without value), 29 (voidable preferences), 30
(undue preferences) and 31 (collusive dealings before sequestration). Because of the view which
I have formed on the facts it is unnecessary to decide this question.
Under the common law, if a disposition has the effect of preferring the alienee above other
creditors and the disposition has been agreed upon in order to defraud creditors, the disposition
may be set aside. The sense in which the expression ""in order to defraud creditors"" is used is
explained by Solomon JA in Trustees, Estate Chin v National Bank of South Africa ltd 1915 AD
353 at 363. If ""the object of the transaction were to give one creditor an unfair advantage over
other creditors in case of insolvency, that would not necessarily be a fraud in the criminal sense
of the word, but it would certainly constitute a fraud upon the creditors within the ordinary
meaning of that expression."" A disposition having that purpose and that effect cannot confer a
title valid against creditors. A person facing insolvency and the person whom he wishes to
advantage may act overtly, if bold or merely naive, but it is more usual that an attempt will be
made to conceal their true purpose. Once exposed such an attempt is of no avail, as the law is
concerned with the actual intention of the parties to a transaction: Erf 318/1 Ladysmith (Pty) Ltd
and Another v Commissioner for Inland Revenue 1996 (3) SA 942 (A) at 952 F. It is against this
background that the decisions in Snyman v Rheeder NO 1989 (4) SA 496 (T) at 505 I - 506 B and
Jooste v de Witt NO 1999 (2) SA 355 (T) 361 J - 362 E should be viewed. In those cases it was
correctly held that, after putting any simulation aside, it is the validity of the true transaction that
must be examined in order to ascertain whether a title valid against creditors has been
established for the purposes of s 21 (2) (c). This conclusion is reached without any resort to s 31
of the statute (collusive dealing). Nor, since the amendment of the law in 1984, is the enquiry
whether the true transaction is a donation, as even a donation can now found such title. It is a
collusive donation, not any donation, just as any other collusive transaction, that will not satisfy
the requirements of the section. As far as onus is concerned, s 21 (2) expressly places the onus
on the solvent spouse, and I do not think that that onus is discharged simply by pointing to the
ostensible transaction (in this case the sale) and saying to the trustee ""It is now your turn to do
your worst with it"". The onus is on the solvent spouse to prove the true transaction and that it is a
valid one such as may confer a valid title. Validity is usually closely related to the parties’
knowledge of the alienor’s actual or imminent insolvency. In a case such as the present there are
several theoretical possibilities, in the light of the queries raised by the trustees: that the entire
transaction was not a sale at all but a collusive donation, that it was a sale but the price was
collusively diminished or, again, that it was a sale but with the price collusively agreed not to be
paid by the wife (which latter is really a donation). In my opinion the facts clearly indicate that the
true intention of the parties was a collusive donation agreed upon in order to prejudice creditors
and save the home for themselves, which donation they sought to disguise by a simulation - the
sale. This means that the wife has not discharged the onus of proving valid title. I would add that
even if the onus had rested on the trustee, I consider that she would have discharged it. My
reasons for these conclusions are set out below.

The papers and much of the heads of argument were directed to the sale in May 1990 as
constituting the disposition under consideration. If one were concerned with the statute then this
sale would constitute a ""disposition"", as the wide definition of that term in s 1 of the Act includes a
sale. But it also includes a transfer. However, I consider that the answer should be sought in the
common law. The act with which the common law concerns itself is alienation - see eg Voet
42.8.1 and van der Keessel Theses Selectae 200 (Lorenz translation 67) and the transfer in
September 1991 was an alienation. Although it is necessary to analyse the sale in some detail in
order to understand the entire course of dealing, in the end the emphasis will fall upon the
transfer, because, although the insolvent may have been precariously solvent in May 1990, by
September 1991 he was bereft of assets whilst still subject to a substantial liability, and also
because it is the transfer that is ultimately relevant to the validity of the wife’s title.
When the evidence is considered one is struck by the generality of much of what is presented by
the wife on important matters and by the paucity and patchiness of documentary support . It was
not that she was not forewarned. The trustee warned her at an early stage that her duty entailed
that she had to be presented with sufficient evidence before she could release assets. In her
answering affidavit the trustee raised pertinently those things that troubled her, and which in her
opinion required explanation. Yet in her reply the wife went so far as to say that she had already
largely dealt with the real points of dispute in her founding affidavit. Although she did attempt to
deal with some of the points raised in the answer, her tendency was to be dismissive and not to
face up to them squarely. Perhaps that was because it was not possible for her to do so.
A convenient starting point is the purchase price for the home fixed in the contract between the
spouses on 23 May 1990. It was R 67 000, payable in cash against registration of transfer.
Questions have been raised by the trustee both as to whether the price was related to market
value, and, in any event, as to what, if anything, the wife paid out of her own, rather than the
insolvent’s estate.
As to the true value of the home, the trustee points to the fact that when the insolvent bought it in
1981 or 1982 (transfer was registered on 21 May 1982) the price was already R 62 500. No
mention of this price was made in the founding papers. An appreciation of a mere R 4500 over
eight years of the inflationery 80s is most unlikely, the trustee contends. In her reply the wife
brushes aside the price that the insolvent paid as irrelevant. The striking fact is that nowhere does
she attempt to make out a positive case as to what the market value was in 1990 or in 1991.
Indeed she goes so far as to say in her reply that in the context of the transaction with the
insolvent the actual market value in 1990 is an irrelevance. This attitude is confirmed by another
passage in her reply, in which she says that she and the insolvent had regard to all the facts and
circumstances at the time when they determined the price. For her part she was satisfied that she
had been compensated for all that she had paid out on the insolvent’s behalf in the past (what
she meant by this will become apparent later). However, in the founding affidavit the emphasis
had been somewhat different - not on what the spouses had determined - but rather: ""Hierdie
koopprys [R 67 000] is destyds deur prokureur Bouwer van Graaff-Reinet bepaal . . ."". For
whatever reason, in her reply she asserted ""Nêrens het ek beweer dat . . . Bouwer die eiendom
waardeer het nie"" (both emphases my own). What the point of the reference to Bouwer was,
other than to lend an air of respectability to the transaction, is unclear. The passage quoted from
the founding affidavit involving Bouwer is followed by another invocation of authoritative
confirmation in these terms: "". . . Hereregte is ook op slegs hierdie bedrag betaal, wat deur die
Ontvanger van Inkomste as die billike markwaarde aanvaar is."" What the Receiver was told,
other than that the cash price was R 67 000, we are not informed. Had he had sight of the wife’s
papers in this case, never mind those of the trustee, his assessment of transfer duty might have
been different.
A further important fact put forward by the trustee is to be found in the affidavit of the insolvent
which he filed in an application in mid 1989 by Boland Bank to sequestrate his estate. The
insolvent succeeded in his opposition, but what is now of importance is that in his list of assets he

reflected the home as being worth R 120 000. In her reply the wife brushes this aside with the
remark: ""Ek kan nie verantwoordelikheid aanvaar vir die insolvent se opinie van wat die eiendom
in 1989 werd sou wees nie."" Elsewhere in her reply she describes this value as irrelevant. The
matter cannot be so simple. The two spouses are still married and live together. She is accused
of having colluded with him. He made an affidavit in support of the founding affidavit, even if it
was in simple confirmatory form. But no explanation of this value of R 120 000 is given by him in
the reply. Accordingly, looking only at the facts mentioned so far, before one even looks at the
valuations put in by the trustee, there must be a strong suspicion that the home was worth much
more than R 67 000 in 1990 and in 1991.
The trustee has produced two valuations of the home made by an appraiser, one Levitt, in
November 1996. His valuation at that date is R 250 000, and at May 1990, approximately R 180
000. In making these valuations he took into account that the property was not in a good state of
repair. The wife has raised a series of objections to the these valuations, questioning both their
admissibility (because Levitt did not make an affidavit) and their worth. For instance, she
contends that the appraiser is not acquainted with the area and has not viewed the interior.
However, I do not consider that these valuations can be brushed aside as incapable of giving
even an approximate value much in excess of the 1990 purchase price. Particularly is this so
when the wife has made no attempt to put forward a lower valuation in reply. Indeed, as I have
indicated already, in her reply she treats market value as an irrelevance. The result is that the
strong suspicion mentioned in the previous paragraph is strengthened.
Nor does the wife make a persuasive case that she paid R 67 000 out of her own separate estate
and not out of her husband’s. Her case is that she had a substantial estate of her own, partly built
up out of her independent farming activities, carried out on the insolvent’s farms. I shall return to
this subject. Her version of the payment of the price is that she paid a total of R 56 511,79 direct
to the bondholder, Allied Building Society, by means of two payments out of her bank account, of
R 12 000,00 on 28 February 1990 (before the sale) and R 44 511,79 on 8 June 1990. The
balance of the price of R 10 488,21 was paid by way of further set-off of amounts owed to her by
the insolvent. The ""further"" set-off is a reference to her earlier statement that in arriving at the
price of R 67 000 the spouses had already given her credit for the fact that since 1986 she had
paid a total of R 35 000 as instalments on the Allied bond over the home. A difficulty with both the
R 10 488,21 and the R 35 000 is that in the insolvent’s affidavit in mid 1989, already referred to,
when he lists his liabilities, he makes no mention of any debts owed to his wife. Again no
explanation is given. Nor is there any objective evidence that an indebtedness existed. It must be
borne in mind that on the wife’s own showing the insolvent was hard pressed for money
continuously after 1986, so that any payments she may have made for his benefit may well have
been paid as part of her duty of support or even as a means of keeping a roof over her own head.
These problems are simply not addressed. It is all too easy for spouses staring insolvency in the
face to fashion out of the past liabilities that were not there before. No attempt is made by the wife
to establish in detail how the
R 10 488,21 was made up. Even in her reply she is content to say ""Deurdat die insolvent veel
meer as R 10 488,21 op die betrokke datum [23 May 1990] aan my verskuldig was uit hoofde
daarvan dat ek finansiële bystand aan hom verleen het, het skuldvergelyking plaasgevind."" As far
as the two payments to Allied are concerned there is, as will be explained later, the additional
question as to whether the funds in the wife’s bank account in May 1990 were all her own.
In order to examine the wife’s claim that she was using her own money and also to test her claim
that the spouses believed that the insolvent had weathered his troubles and was not faced by
probable insolvency, it is necessary to look at their financial histories more closely. The wife says
that she had an estate of her own acquired from non-farming sources between 1956 and 1982. It
was derived from pension moneys paid out to her when she gave up teaching, and sundry gifts
and inheritances, none of which was large. From the time of her marriage in 1957 she earned an
income from the sale of cream, milk, butter, eggs and vegetables. She acquired some stud

Jerseys which she marked with her own brand. She had to sell them in the 1967 drought. When it
was over she used the proceeds to buy some angora goats, as also some milk goats. These also
bore her brand. Later she acquired some sheep, which were branded as hers. By means of
careful husbanding of her income she acquired livestock, implements and other farming
necessaries. Because of the insolvent’s sale of his farms towards the end of 1989, she was
obliged to sell these things in late February 1990. Up to this point she has given no figures of her
farming income or the proceeds of the disposal of her farming assets. She then claims that she
received R 110 625, 45 for this disposal, relying upon a credit transfer in that amount to her
Nedbank account at George on 9 November 1990. The subject of the transaction is described as
a transfer by First National Bank at Graaff-Reinet of an investment comprising capital and
interest. Other than a general statement that these moneys were derived from the sale of her
farming assets, we are given no details of the sale of the assets, or of the creation of the
investment. Because there are no details of the sale there is no evidence, other than the wife’s
say so and the insolvent’s laconic confirmation, that these moneys were hers and not derived
from the sale of some of his assets.
On her version the insolvent’s farming, to avail oneself of the Afrikaans expression, went
backwards. After the collapse of the goat and ostrich markets, in 1986 the Boland Bank, which
had a bond over his farms, terminated his credit facilities. As a result he suffered an acute
shortage of working capital and had to devote all his income to paying creditors. She had to use
some of her own funds to ease his cash flow problems. She claims to have paid R 35 000 to the
Allied Building society in instalments on the bond over the home, at least R 38 658,25 to the Land
Bank, which also had a bond over the farms, and sundry current farming expenses. In fact in the
last few years preceding 1990 she claimed to have maintained him. Late in 1987 she became a
member of the co-operative (Boeremakelaars (Koöp) Beperk - ""BKB""). She states this fact in
order to bolster her claim that she was farming on her own account on a substantial scale, but
does not explain why it was only in 1987 that she became a member. Nor are any BKB accounts
annexed, either for herself or the insolvent (assuming that he was a member - we are not told).
Such accounts would probably have been revealing. In September and October 1987 the
insolvent was obliged to sell five bakkies in order to provide working capital. In addition he sold a
1984 Audi motorcar to the wife.
In the meantime the insolvent, perennially short of funds, was still farming on Vredelus,
Voorspoed, Skoongezicht, Spioenkop and Eiland, principally with 2500 angora goats. On 12 July
1989 Boland Bank obtained a provisional order of sequestration against him. The affidavit filed by
him in those proceedings is the one already referred to, in which he lists his assets and liabilities.
Livestock was reflected as being worth R 608 850 (after shearing) and implements R 250 000. A
surplus of assets over liabilities of R 1 273 458,60 was reflected. Not surprisingly, on this version
the provisional order was discharged on 17 August 1989. But the insolvent’s farming days were
ending. In December 1989 he sold his farms. We are not told what the price was. It is common
cause that the proceeds were sufficient to settle the claims of the bondholders Boland Bank and
the Land Bank, and that they were paid. We are also not told what was received for livestock and
implements (not long before valued at R 608 850 and R 250 000 respectively). However that may
be, it appears to be common cause that on 18 June 1990 creditors (save one to be mentioned
below) were paid, whoever they were and in whatever amounts. (The affidavit of mid 1989 had
shown only one creditor other than Boland Bank and the Land Bank, and that was Allied, which
was owed R 53 000 on the bond over the home).
In her founding affidavit the wife says that upon the sale of the farms the spouses expected there
to be a surplus and that is how it turned out when the proceeds were received. In her reply she
claims that the surplus amounted to   R 75 418,89. This she seeks to establish by reference to a
letter from attorney Bouwer in April 1992, setting out total proceeds (from the sale of what
exactly?) as R 1 682 601,68, the payments to the two farm bondholders and the expenses
incurred in respect of commission and advertising, leaving the balance mentioned available for
the insolvent. The trustee has had no opportunity to deal with this letter and it may be ignored as

possible support for the wife’s case. But it should not be ignored for the admissions it contains,
concerning what the wife says happened to the surplus. It was used to buy annuities
(unspecified), to compensate two sons for the inadequate renumeration they had received from
the insolvent when farming with him, and to provide for a recently divorced daughter, who was
unable to maintain herself. No dates or further details are given. It is most improbable that she did
not know of the insolvent’s intentions with regard to the few worldly goods that would be left to
him. In any event she does not claim such ignorance. Her reply proceeds:
""Die insolvent was omdat hy sy plase verkoop het en dus sy boerdery gelikwideer het en die
opbrengs daarvan aangewend het nie in staat om die verbandpaaiemente ten opsigte van die
onroerende eiendom [the home] verder te betaal nie en hy moes daarvan ontslae raak"" [thus
leading on to the sale to her].
Apart from contradicting her statement in the founding affidavit that she had been paying the
instalments on the home since 1986, the clear implication is that already by May 1990 the
spouses contemplated that the insolvent would be left with practically nothing. If there was a
creditor who had not been paid, and provision had not been made for him, then it seems clear
that allowing the wife to set off her claims of R 35 000,00 and R 10 488,21 (assuming that she
had such claims) constituted an undue preference and, in addition, that the payments to the
children are suspect as dispositions without value, to the detriment of that creditor. Nor is there
any attempt to explain why part of the surplus of R 75 418,89 was not used to pay off the bond
over the home, seemingly the obvious destination of these funds .
There was such a creditor, the Davis Myles Trust (""the Trust""). The payment of its claim, which
existed well before 1989, was delayed by litigation for years, but it was the claim upon which the
insolvent’s estate was ultimately sequestrated on 2 March 1995. The explanation offered in the
founding affidavit for the non-payment of the Trust was the following:
""Op hierdie stadium [late 1989 early 1990] was die insolvent ook in besit van voldoende sybokke
om aan die Davis Myles Trust te lewer. Lewering kon toe nie geskied nie omdat die insolvent nie
geweet het op watter plek die sybokke gelewer moes word nie. Uiteindelik kon die insolvent nie
die sybokke lewer nie omdat die sybokke wat vir daardie doel op Voorspoed by die nuwe eienaar
van die plaas gelaat is, nie meer daar was nie. . . ."" (Own emphasis).
We are not told what the goats were worth or what, if anything, was done to recover from the new
owner of Voorspoed. The Trust had sued the insolvent for the purchase price of R 79 000, and,
according to the reply, the action had been set down for hearing on 14 May 1990 (that is just nine
days before the sale of the home to the wife). The matter was postponed because it might be
settled by an agreement that the insolvent deliver goats rather than pay money. At the time, so
the reply tells us, the insolvent had the goats needed, but by the time the anticipated settlement
was concluded in 1992 they were ""egter nie meer beskikbaar nie"". Nor had the insolvent the
money to buy them in. In argument an attempt was made to wish away the Trust’s claim by
suggesting that because of its failure to take back goats when tendered by the insolvent it placed
itself in mora creditoris, so that when the goats somehow disappeared, the risk of loss, so it was
suggested, fell upon the Trust. Apart from other possible difficulties with this contention, its fatal
defect is that it was not raised in the founding affidavit. What was said in the founding affidavit I
have already quoted.
Summons based on the settlement was issued by the Trust in January 1993. The claim was for
260 ewes with lambs, alternatively their value, being R 45 500. Judgment was later taken for R 53
000 and it was on this debt that the insolvent’s estate was eventually sequestrated in 1995. The
insolvent’s subsequent statement of affairs reflected the R 53 000 as his only debt, apart from an
unexplained claim of  R 50 000 by the wife. Leaving aside the complexities which might seem to
exist in the present litigation, the essential dispute is whether the Trust is entitled to have its claim
paid out of the proceeds of the home preferently to, or conceivably, concurrently with, the wife. In

her reply the wife says that in May 1990 (when the home was sold to her) the goats (then still in
existence) were worth considerably more than  R 45 000. The ""considerably more"" is presumably
a reference to the difference between the R 75 418,89 mentioned before and
R 45 500. This explanation or justification overlooks two things. The first is that at the time the
Trust’s claim was not for R 45 500 but for R 79 000 plus costs plus interest. The second is that in
the interim, in terms of the wife’s own affidavit, the surplus had simply been handed out to the
children or used in the purchase of annuities, so that when the time came to purchase goats the
cupboard was bare.
The dissipation of the R 75 418,89 affords a simple basis for allowing the appeal, because the
inevitable conclusion on the papers is that after it had taken place and before the transfer of the
home, the insolvent’s assets were all gone, (this could not be contested by Mr van der Walt, for
the wife), whereas he still faced the claim of the Trust. In addition, as I have pointed out already,
the strong probability is that the wife knew all of these things. When taken together with the
unsatisfactory features surrounding the sale which I have mentioned, and the insufficiencies of
the evidence produced by the wife, both already mentioned and to be mentioned in the next
paragraph, I think that the conclusion is inevitable that the spouses colluded to defraud the Trust.
Not surprisingly, there is not much evidence that the trustee has produced to contradict positively
the history put forward by the wife. But the trustee has raised serious suspicions, largely based
on the wife’s version and lack of version. On the other hand, I find the combined effect of the
affidavits of the two spouses to be selective, evasive, unpersuasive and at times contradictory.
Thus the wife annexes tax assessments in her own name for the years 1993 to 1995, informing
us that before that it was not the practice for wives to render separate returns. But no mention is
made of the husband’s returns in the preceding years. They may have told us much about his
income, her income, and their respective assets and liabilities. Then she tells us that throughout
she had her own cheque account, first at Volkskas, Aberdeen, and after May 1990 at Nedbank,
George. She produces the Volkskas Bank statements ranging from April 1988 to 23 May 1990
(which happens to be the date of sale of the home, and which seems to be the date on which the
Volkskas account was closed). She also annexes some of the cheques drawn on this account.
The difficulty is that the great bulk of them, although drawn on an account in her name, are
signed by the insolvent, not herself. She also annexes numerous post May 1990 cheques drawn
on Nedbank, George. All of them are signed by the insolvent, not herself. So whose bank
accounts were these really? Nor are we told who was responsible for the credits or what they
were. Hardly any deposit slips have been produced. We are not told if the insolvent had his own
cheque account. Nor are we told whether either spouse had other accounts, such as savings
accounts. What, for instance, was the nature of the ""investment"" transferred from Graaff-Reinet in
November 1990? The wife may well be correct in saying that many past records have been
destroyed, but it does not seem to me that, despite many warnings by the trustee to do so, she
has made a genuine attempt to reconstruct a true picture.
In the court below van Deventer J inclined to the view that the onus did not rest on the wife (for
reasons that are not clear), but concluded, in any event, that ""there is no evidence here to justify
an inference, on a balance of probabilities, that the sale of the house was a simulated transaction
or that the applicant acted as a nominee or dummy for her husband or that the sale amounted to
a collusive dealing."" For the reasons given I cannot agree with this conclusion.
The appeal is upheld with costs. The order of the court a quo is replaced with the following:
""The application is dismissed with costs.""

JUDGMENT
________________________________________________________
SMALBERGER JA . . .

SMALBERGER JA:
[1] The appellant, who pleaded guilty, was convicted of two counts of
theft in the Magistrate’s Court, Johannesburg.  She was sentenced to eight
and twelve months’ imprisonment respectively on the two counts.  On
appeal against her sentence to the Witwatersrand Local Division she
sought condonation for the late filing of both her amended grounds of
appeal and her heads of argument.  Her application for condonation was
refused for want of reasonable prospects of success on appeal.  This
allowed the appellant to appeal directly to this Court against such refusal
in terms of sec 21(1) read with sec 22 of the Supreme Court Act 59 of
1959, no leave to appeal being required (S v Gopal 1993(2) SACR
584(A)).  The anomaly occasioned by this situation is a matter to which

I shall revert.
[2] The first count of theft involved an amount of R1699,22 cash stolen
on 20 October 1995; the second involved the theft of R3320,12 cash on
8 November 1995.  Both amounts were stolen from the appellant’s
employer, Tiger Wheel and Tyre, where she was employed as a credit
controller.  She had been so employed for about a year preceding the
thefts.
[3] The appellant was legally represented at her trial.  She elected not
to give evidence.  The defence called as witnesses Ms Adams, a social
worker employed by the Department of Correctional Services, and Ms
Fouche, a probation officer from the Department of Social Welfare.  Both
had previously prepared reports relating to sentence.
[4] The following emerges from the record with regard to the

appellant’s personal circumstances at the time of the trial.  The appellant
was 40 years of age, divorced, with one child aged 20 years who is self-
supporting (the one report refers to the child as a son, the other as a
daughter!).  The appellant shared a home with five of her siblings who
were largely dependant upon her for support.  The appellant matriculated
in 1974 and had for the most part been in permanent employment since
then.  She lost her employment because of the thefts.  At the time she was
earning R3700,00 per month.  She subsequently managed to obtain similar
employment at a slightly higher monthly salary.  Her new employer, for
whom she was working at the time of the trial, was unaware of the
offences that she had committed.  The appellant repaid the money she
stole within two months of committing the offences.
[5] The appellant has two previous convictions.  The first, for fraud

involving a cheque for R41,00, was in January 1982.  She was sentenced
to a fine of R120,00 or 120 days imprisonment.  The second, in December
1991, was for fraud involving forged banknotes to the value of R5600,00.
On that occasion she was sentenced to a fine of R5000,00 or 150 days
imprisonment.
[6] The only information on record as to why the appellant committed
the offences is to be found in the report of Ms Fouche.  It appears from
her report that one of the appellant’s sisters is an epileptic and diabetic.
The appellant allegedly required money to bring her sister from East
London to Gauteng and for that reason “borrowed” money from her
employer intending to pay it back later.  According to the report, because
of her other family commitments “was daar geen ekstra geld beskikbaar
nie en gevolglik het sy nie geld gehad toe haar suster se mediese probleme

in November 1995 opgeduik het nie.”  The sister in question is now being
properly cared for as a hospital outpatient and is receiving free medical
treatment.  The appellant apparently expressed remorse for what she did.
[7] Both Ms Adams and Ms Fouche considered the appellant to be a
suitable candidate for correctional supervision, and both recommended
that form of punishment.  In sentencing the appellant, the trial magistrate
took note of their recommendations.  He was of the view that correctional
supervision might have been an appropriate sentence had the appellant
been a first offender.  He concluded, however, mainly because of the
appellant’s previous convictions, the seriousness of the offences, the
prevalence of such offences within his district and the fact that the
appellant had abused a position of trust, that, notwithstanding her personal
circumstances and other mitigating factors, imprisonment was the only

appropriate sentence in the circumstances.  That led him to impose the
sentence which he did.
[8] It is trite law that sentencing is pre-eminently a matter for the
discretion of the trial court.  Interference with a sentence on appeal is not
justified in the absence of a material misdirection or irregularity, or the
sentence imposed is so startlingly inappropriate as to create a sense of
shock.
[9] It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the magistrate had
misdirected himself in two respects.  In the course of his judgment the
magistrate voiced certain doubts as to the reason given by the appellant
for stealing the money and whether she had financial difficulties, in the
latter instance having regard to the fact that she repaid the amount she had
taken within two months.  It was contended, with reference to S v Caleni

1990(1) SACR 178 (C) at 181a - i, that the magistrate was bound by the
undisputed facts and was accordingly not entitled to entertain the doubts
he did.
[10] As pointed out by the court a quo, the magistrate did not reject any
statement of the appellant as false.  He merely expressed some doubt as
to the veracity of her statements to Ms Fouche.  His doubt was not
without justification.  The appellant elected not to give evidence.  Her
failure to do so has left a number of unanswered questions.  Why if, as she
said, “haar suster se mediese probleme in November 1995 opgeduik het”
was there a need to steal money in October 1995? Why did she have to
steal twice, and why the amount she did? Why did she not try and borrow
money from her employer, and how did she manage to pay back the
money so soon?

[11] In my view the magistrate’s doubts were legitimate ones
occasioned by the appellant’s failure to take the court into her confidence.
In the circumstances I do not consider the magistrate’s expression of
doubt to have constituted a misdirection.  But even if it did, I agree with
the court a quo that it was clearly not material in the sense that it caused
the magistrate not to exercise his discretion at all, or to exercise it
improperly or unreasonably (S v Pillay 1977(4) SA 531 (A) at 535F).
[12] The other suggested misdirection was that the magistrate failed
when sentencing the appellant to have regard to the fact that the previous
sentences imposed upon her were probably ineffective in bringing home
to her the seriousness of her past conduct.  Reliance in this regard was
placed on S v Dreyer 1990(2) SACR 445 (A) at 448b - c.  The facts of
that case are clearly distinguishable from the present.  The appellant is not

an uneducated or unsophisticated person.  The sentence for her second
conviction, although it did not involve imprisonment or a suspended
sentence, was not insubstantial.  Her past brushes with the law must have
alerted her to the real possibility of imprisonment for similar conduct in
future.  There is in my view no basis for holding that the magistrate
misdirected himself in this respect.
[13] All that remains is whether the sentences imposed, viewed singly
or cumulatively, induce a sense of shock.  I have sympathy for the fact
that imprisonment will mean that the appellant will lose her current
employment and that those who are dependent upon her will suffer as a
result.  The magistrate had a duty to consider not only the position of the
appellant, but the nature of the crimes committed and the wider interests
of the community.  I agree that the facts of the case coupled with the

appellant’s previous convictions render correctional supervision
inappropriate.  Imprisonment was called for, and having regard mainly to
the considerations mentioned in paragraph [7] above it cannot, in my
view, be said that the sentences induce a sense of shock.
[14] In the result the court a quo was correct in concluding that the
appellant did not have reasonable prospects of success on appeal, and the
appeal must fail.  I would go further and say that if the appeal before us
was not only against the refusal to grant condonation, but in respect of the
sentence itself, I would have dismissed the appeal.  The applications for
condonation before this Court for the late filing of (1) the notice of appeal
and (2) the record must likewise fail for lack of prospects of success.  I
propose to make no further order in regard to them.
[15] I return to the anomaly I alluded to in paragraph [1].  In S v Gopal

(supra) at 585b - e Harms AJA said the following:
“Hierdie appèl illustreer die ongewenstheid van die
(vermoedelik onvoorsiene) teenstrydigheid tussen die
bepalings van die Strafproseswet 51 van 1977 ten aansien
van appèlle en art 21(1) saamgelees met art 22 van die Wet
op die Hooggeregshof 59 van 1959.  Meer spesifiek, indien
‘n persoon in die landdroshof aan ‘n misdryf skuldig bevind
en gevonnis word en sy appèl na die Provinsiale (of, indien
van toepassing, die Plaaslike) Afdeling van die
Hooggeregshof misluk, mag hy alleen met die nodige verlof
na hierdie Hof appelleer.  As hy egter sou nalaat om sy
eerste appèl na behore voort te sit en dit nodig is om
kondonasie te verkry (soos bv vir die laat aantekening van
appèl) en dié aansoek misluk, het hy ‘n outomatiese reg van
appèl teen die afwys van sy aansoek na hierdie Hof.  Dit
geld selfs indien sy aansoek vanweë ‘n gebrek aan
vooruitsigte op appèl afgewys is.  S v Tsedi 1984 (1) SA 565
(A); S v Absalom 1989 (3) SA 154 (A).  En sou hierdie Hof
argumentsonthalwe bevind dat die Hof a quo verkeerd was
in sy beoordeling van die kanse op sukses, en die appèl
slaag, moet die strafappèl dan waarskynlik deur daardie Hof
bereg word met die wete dat hierdie Hof reeds ‘n oordeel,
wat nie bindend is nie, oor die meriete uitgespreek het.”
(See too S v N 1991(2) SACR 10 (A) at 16a - d)

[16] This unfortunate state of affairs, which has the potential to
unnecessarily burden this Court by adding to its already heavy workload,
has been allowed to persist.  It is to be hoped that the Legislature will
urgently give its attention to resolving the conflict that exists between the
statutory provisions referred to in Gopal’s case. In the meantime courts
below hearing appeals should bear in mind the consequence of a refusal
of condonation, as opposed to the dismissal of an appeal, and deal with
matters before them in a manner that will preclude appeals to this Court
that are without merit.

[17] The appeal is dismissed.

Suretyship - formal validity - rectification - costs.

JUDGMENT
________________________________________________________

. . . SMALBERGER JA

SMALBERGER JA:

[1] The appellant applied in the Witwatersrand Local Division for
default judgment in terms of rule 31(2)(a) read with rule 31(4) of the
Uniform Rules of Court in respect of an action instituted by it against the
respondent to rectify a deed of suretyship (Athe suretyship@), payment of
the amount claimed to be due by the respondent in terms of the (rectified)
suretyship, interest on such amount and costs on the attorney and client
scale.
[2] The matter came before Malan J who refused the application.
Leave to appeal was also refused but was subsequently granted by this
Court on petition to the Chief Justice.  At the hearing of the appeal there
was no appearance on behalf of the respondent.
[3] The suretyship, ineptly adapted from a form apparently used by a

commercial bank, describes the parties as follows in clause 1:
A1.1.  Intercontinental Exports (Pty) Ltd, its successors-in-
title and assigns (hereinafter referred to as >I.C.E.=)
1.2.  Mr Frank Fowles and Mrs. Linda Fowles c/o 113 Smit
Street, Braamfontein, Johannesburg (hereinafter referred to
as >the Debtor=)
and
1.3.  The party executing this suretyship as surety and co-
principal debtor or each party executing this suretyship as a
surety and co-principal debtors, as the case may be
(hereinafter referred as >the Surety=).@

[4] In the preamble (clause 2) it is recorded:
Athat this suretyship is furnished in consideration of I.C.E.
allowing the Debtor or any third party all or any part of
whose present or future indebtedness to I.C.E. has been or
will be guaranteed by the Debtor such banking facilities as
I.C.E. may in its sole discretion deem fit (either by way of
the continuation of any existing facilities or by the
provision of new or further facilities or both).@

[5] In terms of clause 3:
AThe Suretyship [the word used] binds and interposes

himself as surety and co-principal debtor in solidum for the
Debtor=s indebtedness generally to I.C.E. howsoever arising
including . . .@

The suretyship is signed at its end by the respondent whose name is
given in full as AFrank Turner Fowles@.
[6] The appellant=s particulars of claim alleged, inter alia, that:
a)
A company, Security Depot (Proprietary) Limited (Athe company@), was
indebted to the appellant in the sum of R2 178 844,43 in respect of goods
ordered by the company from the appellant between the first quarter of 1996
and April 1997;
b)
During or about April 1997 the respondent bound himself in terms of the
suretyship as surety and co-principal debtor for the company=s indebtedness
to the appellant;
c)
The suretyship incorrectly reflected the agreement between the appellant and
the respondent in the following respects:
A4.1
In clause 1.2 thereof Defendant [respondent] is described as

the debtor, whereas the debtor is the company.
4.2
Plaintiff [appellant] never carried on business as a bank and it
was never the intention of the parties that the >suretyship is
furnished in consideration of ICE allowing the Debtor . . .
banking facilities=, as set out in clause 2 thereof.
4.3
It was never the intention that Defendant would bind himself
as surety and co-principal debtor for his own indebtedness to
Plaintiff.@;

d)
It was the intention of the parties that the respondent would bind himself to
the appellant as surety for the company=s indebtedness to the appellant;
e)
The incorrect description in the suretyship of the debtor as the respondent
instead of the company and the incorporation of clause 2 were occasioned by
a common error;
f)
The appellant was accordingly entitled to rectification of the suretyship by
substituting the words ASecurity Depot (Proprietary) Limited@ for the words
AMr Frank Fowles and@ where they appear in clause 1.2, and the deletion of
clause 2.
[7] Section 6 of the General Law Amendment Act 50 of 1956 (Athe Act@)
provides:

ANo contract of suretyship entered into after the commencement of
this Act, shall be valid, unless the terms thereof are embodied in a
written document signed by or on behalf of the surety . . .@

[8] The Aterms@ contemplated in section 6 as essential to the validity of a contract
of suretyship include the identities of the creditor, the principal debtor and the surety
(Fourlamel (Pty) Ltd v Maddison 1977(1) SA 333 (A) at 345A - D).
[9] In Magwaza v Heenan 1979(2) SA 1019 (A) this Court held that a contract
for the sale of fixed property which is formally invalid (and consequently a nullity)
for want of compliance with section 1(1) of the General Law Amendment Act 68 of
1957, cannot be rectified (at 1029A - C read with 1026A - D).  This principle would
apply equally to a contract of suretyship lacking in essential terms.  The purpose of
the governing statutory enactment in each case, namely, to achieve certainty as to the
true terms agreed upon and thus avoid or minimize the possibility of perjury or fraud
and unnecessary litigation, is the same (Fourlamel (Pty) Ltd v Maddison (supra) at
343A).
[10] That it is not competent to rectify a contract that is invalid for non-
compliance with statutory formalities must therefore be taken to be established law

despite the criticism that has been directed at this view (see eg De Wet en Van Wyk:
Die Suid-Afrikaanse Kontraktereg en Handelsreg:  5th Ed: Vol 1:  323 ff; Tager:
ARectification of Invalid Contracts@ (1977) 94 SALJ 8).  On the other hand, where
such formalities have been complied with, rectification is permissible if the
requirements for rectification have been satisfied (cf Litecor Voltex (Natal) (Pty) Ltd
v Jason 1988(2) SA 78 (D & CLD); Lazarus v Gorfinkel 1988(4) SA 123(C)).  There
are therefore two separate and distinct enquiries in a matter such as the present.  The
first relates to the formal validity of the deed of suretyship; the second to whether the
requirements for rectification have been satisfied.  The factual allegations relevant to
the second enquiry should not be allowed to impinge on the first.
[11] Rectification is a well established common law right.  It provides an equitable
remedy designed to correct the failure of a written contract to reflect the true
agreement between the parties to the contract.  It thereby enables effect to be given to
the parties= actual agreement.  The requirement of formal validity in the case of a
deed of suretyship flows from the Legislature=s perceived need to provide safeguards
in such matters.  To the extent that the need to satisfy the latter may preclude

recourse to the former, tension will inevitably exist between the two.  While care
must be taken not to defeat the object of the Act, the formality requirements must not
be allowed to become an unnecessary stumbling-block to rectification and,
consequently, to giving effect to the true intention of the contracting parties.
[12] The undisputed averments made by the appellant in its particulars of claim
would permit of rectification of the suretyship provided the requirements of section 6
of the Act have been complied with.  The only issue on appeal is, therefore, whether
the suretyship identifies a creditor, principal debtor and surety and is formally valid
on that account.  If it is, it is capable of rectification in the respects claimed by the
appellant as its substantive validity is not in issue.  If not, the appeal must fail.  This
judgment is confined to that issue.
[13] The formal validity of a suretyship agreement must be determined ex facie the
document embodying the suretyship undertaking.  In Spiller and Others v Lawrence
1976(1) SA 307 (N) Didcott J, in explaining the difference between a contract which
is void for want of compliance with essential formalities, and one which is invalid for
some other reason, said the following (at 312B - D):

AThe two situations are fundamentally different.  In the one . . ., when
the question of validity relates to the substance of the transaction and
not its form, nullity is an illusion produced by a document testifying
falsely to what was agreed.  In the other . . . the cause of nullity is
indeed to be found in the transaction=s form.  When it is said to
consist of a failure to observe the law=s requirement that the
agreement be reflected by a document with particular characteristics,
the document itself is necessarily decisive of the issue whether the
stipulation has been met; for it has been only if this emerges from the
document.@

(My emphasis.)

[14] The above passage from Spiller=s case was referred to with apparent approval
by this Court in Headermans (Vryburg) (Pty) Ltd v Ping Bai 1997(3) SA 1004 (SCA)
at 1010F - H.  It also appears to be in accordance with the approach adopted by this
Court in other cases to the effect that one is basically confined to looking at the
particular suretyship agreement to see if it contains the required essentialia (cf
Société Commerciale de Moteurs v Ackermann 1981(3) SA 422 (A) at 438B - 440H;
Du Toit en >n Ander v Barclays Nasionale Bank Bpk 1985(1) SA 563 (A) at 570B to
571E).
[15] The learned judge a quo found, inter alia, that in the suretyship the identity of

the surety Ais left in blank@ and that a space where the name of the principal debtor
should have been entered was also left blank.  I do not propose to review the
provisions of the suretyship in detail.  Clause 1.2 of the suretyship, to which I have
referred, clearly identifies AMr Frank Fowles@ as the principal debtor.  The failure to
refer to him again as such in the space left blank cannot detract from the fact that the
suretyship identifies a principal debtor.  In clause 1.3 the surety has been identified as
the party executing the suretyship.  That party, below his signature, is described as
AFrank Turner Fowles@.  The identity of the surety is therefore also established ex
facie the suretyship.  I accordingly disagree with the findings of the judge a quo in
this regard.  That the suretyship identifies the creditor (I.C.E.) has never been in
dispute.
[16] It was conceded by Mr Engelbrecht, who argued the appeal on behalf of the
appellant, that where it appears conclusively from a deed of suretyship that the
principal debtor and the surety are the same person or legal persona, the deed would
be invalid for want of an essential term, because the person or legal persona could be
either the principal debtor or the surety, but not both, as one cannot stand surety for

one=s own debt (Forsyth and Pretorius: Caney=s The Law of Suretyship: 4th Ed: 40).
One of the necessary parties to a suretyship would therefore be lacking.  The position
would be the same as if the identity of either the principal debtor or the surety were
missing.  A case in point is Republican Press (Pty) Ltd v Martin Murray Associates
CC and Others 1996(2) SA 246 (N), where in the deed of suretyship ARepublican
Press (Pty) Ltd@ featured as both principal debtor and creditor.  Hurt J, delivering the
majority judgment, held (at 251G - H) that:
AIn this case there is no question of the >Republican Press (Pty) Ltd=
cited as the principal debtor, being a different entity to the creditor.@

The finding was clearly justified as there cannot be more than one registered
company with the same name.  In the result it was found that the deed of suretyship
lacked formal validity.  There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the majority
decision in that case.
[17] The present situation differs factually from the one with which the court was
confronted in the Republican Press case (supra).  The principal debtor is referred to
in clause 1.2 of the suretyship as AMr Frank Fowles@.  The name of the surety is

reflected as AFrank Turner Fowles@.  The names, though similar, are not identical, and
ex facie the suretyship do not necessarily refer to the same person.  Even if the two
names were identical, it would not follow as a matter of course that they referred to
the same person.  The parties might, for instance, be father and son who happen to
have the same names, a not uncommon occurrence.  In those circumstances, and a
fortiori in the present, a deed of suretyship would be capable of being construed ex
facie the document itself as reflecting a creditor, principal debtor and surety and
would accordingly be formally valid on that score.
[18] This approach follows a line similar to that taken in exceptions.  An exception
ought not to be upheld unless Aupon every interpretation which the pleading in
question, and in particular the document on which it is based, can reasonably bear, no
cause of action or defence (as the case may be) is disclosed@ (Sun Packaging (Pty)
Ltd v Vreulink 1996(4) SA 176 (A) at 183E - F).  Likewise a deed of suretyship, in
my view, ought not be held to be formally invalid where ex facie the document it is
reasonably capable of an interpretation consistent with validity.
[19] In the Republican Press case (supra) Hurt J, confronted with the argument

that where a father and son, both having the same initials (or names), are respectively
stated to be principal debtor and creditor (or surety) in a suretyship undertaking, the
undertaking could not be presumed to be formally invalid simply because the
principal debtor and creditor were not identified by two different names, said the
following (at 251D - G):
AIt seems to me that there are two conclusive answers to this
proposition.  The first is that if there are indeed two parties to the
suretyship undertaking who have identical names, there will be no
need for a rectification of the document and those parties would
presumably be cited, and separately identified, in any proceedings in
which the document and the question of its enforceability may come
before the Court.  If it were pleaded, in such a case, that the document
was invalid for non-compliance with s 6, that plea could be disposed
of by a replication to the effect that the identical names referred to
two different juristic personae.  The second is that evidence would be
admissible for the limited purposes of identification of the parties to
the undertaking, provided always that the evidence does not encroach
into the prohibited territory demarcated by the parol evidence rule.
(See Sapirstein and Others v Anglo African Shipping Co (SA) Ltd
1978(4) SA 1 (A) at 12D.)  It seems to me that such evidence would
be admissible ante omnia in any situation where there is doubt as to
whether the document refers to three separate parties to the contract
of suretyship.@

[20] With regard to the first answer, it seems to proceed from the premise that the

suretyship undertaking is formally valid.  With regard to the second, the envisaged
evidence would be admissible not to establish the document=s formal validity, but to
give effect to an otherwise valid suretyship.  It would, for example, permit extrinsic
evidence to be led to identify the actual creditor, principal debtor or surety, as the
case may be, from among a group of such named in the written document (see
Sapirstein=s case referred to in the above quotation at 12E - H; cf Federated Timbers
(Pretoria) (Pty) Ltd v Fourie 1978(1) SA 292 (T) at 298F - H).  To that extent the
quoted passage is not inconsistent with the views expressed above.  If by the last
sentence is meant that evidence could be led to show, contrary to what appears ex
facie the document, that a suretyship undertaking lacks formal validity (eg to show
that two of the parties are the same) I would respectfully disagree.  It is for that
reason that regard cannot be had to the undisputed allegation in paragraph 4.1 of the
Particulars of Claim that the respondent is the person described in the suretyship as
the principal debtor in determining the issue of formal validity.
[21] In the result I am of the view that the suretyship was formally valid and that
the appellant is entitled to rectification and default judgment as prayed.

[22] The appellant asks for attorney and client costs both in the court a quo and on
appeal.  It relies in this respect on clause 5 of the suretyship which provides, inter
alia, for unlimited liability on the part of the surety (respondent) and Acosts of
recovery on the attorney and client scale@.  This raises the question whether a court is
obliged to give effect to such an agreement or whether it retains a residual discretion
with regard to costs.
[23] In Claude Neon Lights (SA) Ltd v Peroglou 1977(1) SA 575 (C) it was held
(at 578C) that parties cannot by agreement deprive a court of the discretion it has in
regard to costs.  However, reliance for that proposition appears to have been placed
on a decision where that was assumed, not decided.  In Western Bank Ltd v Meyer;
De Waal; Swart and Another 1973(4) SA 697 (T) the Full Court proceeded on the
premise that agreement could not deprive it of its discretion as to costs (at 701C - G).
In Santam Bank Bpk v Kellerman 1978(1) SA 1159 (C), after a review of the
relevant authorities, the Full Court (per Grosskopf J) pointed out (at 1162A) that
there existed A`n mate van onsekerheid... of die Hof `n residuêre bevoegdheid oorhou
om te weier om so `n ooreenkoms af te dwing@.  The learned judge added:

APersoonlik vind ek dit moeilik om `n beginselgrondslag vir so `n bevoegdheid te
vind@.
[24] In Sapirstein=s case (supra, at 14E - F) this Court left open the question of
whether or not a court retains a residual discretion in the face of an agreement with
regard to costs.  Earlier in the judgment (at 14A - D) it had been said:
AGenerally speaking, awards of costs are, of course, in the discretion
of the Court and that discretion must be judicially exercised whenever
the need arises.  But, accepting this to be the position, I am of the
view that there can be no objection, in principle, to a Court giving
effect to an agreement between parties concerning their liability for
legal costs arising out of a dispute between them.  It is commonplace
for parties to enter into agreements of this sort - for example, parties
often agree that each party shall pay his own costs, or that no award
as to costs shall be made, or that a party=s liability for costs shall be
limited to a particular amount, and so on  - and for the Courts to make
awards in terms of such agreements.  In the present instance the
plaintiff, in stipulating that costs should be paid on the attorney and
client basis, obviously wanted to ensure that it would not be out of
pocket in respect of any legal costs incurred in connection with
disputes arising out of the agreement.  The purpose of an award of
costs is to indemnify a party >for the expense to which he has been put
through having been unjustly compelled either to institute or defend
litigation, as the case may be= (per Innes CJ in Texas Co (SA) Ltd v
Cape Town Municipality 1926 AD 467 at 485) and, if a contracting

party wants to ensure that he is fully indemnified against such
expenses, there is, in my view, no reason why he should not be
entitled to stipulate that such costs, if incurred, should be paid on the
attorney and client scale.@

[25] The basic rule is that, statutory limitations apart, all costs awards are in the
discretion of the court (Kruger Bros & Wasserman v Ruskin 1918 AD 63 at 69, a
decision which has consistently been followed).  The court=s discretion is a wide,
unfettered and equitable one.  It is a facet of the court=s control over the proceedings
before it.  It is to be exercised judicially with due regard to all relevant
considerations.  These would include the nature of the litigation being conducted
before it and the conduct of the parties (or their representatives).  A court may wish,
in certain circumstances, to deprive a party of costs, or a portion thereof, or order
lesser costs than it might otherwise have done, as a mark of its displeasure at such
party=s conduct in relation to the litigation.  Is it to be precluded by agreement from
doing so? A court should not be obliged to give its imprimatur to an order of costs
which, in the circumstances, it considers entirely inappropriate or undeserved.  In my
view, as a matter of policy and principle, a court should not, and must not, permit the

ouster of its discretion because of agreement between the parties with regard to costs.
[26] Because a court exercises its discretion judicially, not capriciously, it would
normally be bound to recognise the parties= freedom to contract and to give effect to
any agreement reached in relation to costs.  But good grounds may exist, depending
upon the particular circumstances, for following a different course.  This might
result, on a proper exercise of discretion, in a party being deprived of agreed costs, or
being awarded something less in the way of costs than that agreed upon.
[27] As pointed out in Sapirstein=s case (supra) at 14C, the purpose of an award of
costs is to indemnify a party.  By stipulating for attorney and client costs a party
seeks even greater indemnity for costs incurred through having to pursue a claim in
court.  In the present instance the appellant, in order to obtain judgment against the
respondent, was obliged to come to court in order to have the suretyship rectified.
This was occasioned by its own ineptitude in using an inappropriate form for the
deed of suretyship and then having it completed in respects which did not properly
reflect what had been agreed upon.  While there might have been some fault on the

respondent=s part in signing the suretyship in that form, it was of a much lesser
degree than that of the appellant.  The respondent did not oppose either the relief
sought in the court below or the appeal.  It was through no fault of the respondent
that the court a quo found against the appellant on an issue which, largely through its
own doing, it was obliged to take to court and thereafter on appeal.  In the
circumstances good grounds exist, in the exercise of our discretion, for not giving
effect to the agreement in the suretyship relating to attorney and client costs, and for
awarding costs only on the party and party scale.
[28] The following order is made:
1)
The appeal is allowed with costs.
2)
The order of the court a quo is set aside and there is substituted in  its stead
the following:
AThere will be judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the
defendant for:
(a)
An order rectifying the deed of suretyship, annexure >WL1' to the
particulars of claim, by the substitution of the words >Security Depot
(Proprietary) Limited= for the words >Mr Frank Fowles and= where
they appear in clause 1.2 thereof and by the deletion of clause 2
thereof in its entirety;

(b)
Payment of the amount of R2 178 844,43;
(c)
Interest at the rate of 24% per annum on the amount of R2 178 844,43
from 1 August 1997 to date of payment;
(d)
Costs of suit on the party and party scale.@

Motorvoertuigongelukkefondswet 93 van 1989 is ultra vires.]
_________________________________________________________
UITSPRAAK

. . . SMALBERGER AR

SMALBERGER AR:
Die enigste vraag wat in hierdie appèl ontstaan, is of
regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) van die regulasies uitgevaardig ingevolge artikel 6 van
die Multilaterale Motorvoertuigongelukkefondswet 93 van 1989 (“die
Wet”) ultra vires die magtigende bepalings van die Wet is.
Regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) bepaal:
“Die aanspreeklikheid van die MMF ingevolge die
Ooreenkoms ten opsigte van eise vir liggaamlike beserings
of dood wat ontsaan uit die bestuur van ‘n motorvoertuig
waarvan nóg die eienaar nóg die bestuurder se identiteit
vasgestel kan word (hierna die ‘ongeïdentifiseerde
motorvoertuig’ genoem) is onderworpe aan die volgende
voorwaardes:
a)
die MMF loop geen aanspreeklikheid op nie tensy -
. . . . .
v)
die ongeïdentifiseerde motorvoertuig (met
inbegrip van enigiets daarop, daarbinne of
daaraan geheg) in fisiese kontak was met die
beseerde of oorledene of met ‘n ander persoon,
voertuig, vervoermiddel of ander voorwerp of

voorwerpe wat regstreeks of onregstreeks die
besering of dood veroorsaak het of daartoe
bygedra het.”
Die omstandighede wat aanleiding gee tot die appèl is die volgende.
Die respondent het in die Transvaalse Provinsiale Afdeling aksie teen die
appellant (“die MMF”) ingestel vir skadevergoeding voortspruitend uit
liggaamlike beserings wat deur hom opgedoen is op 30 Mei 1991 toe ‘n
voertuig deur hom bestuur op die N1 roete tussen Winburg en
Ventersburg, die pad verlaat het en omgeval het (“die ongeluk”).  Volgens
die respondent was die ongeluk te wyte aan die nalatige bestuur van ‘n
ongeïdentifiseerde voertuig wat skielik na regs gedraai het toe hy besig
was om dit verby te steek.
Die verhoor was, volgens ooreenkoms, beperk tot die meriete van
die respondent se eis.  Die verhoorhof het bevind dat die ongeluk

uitsluitlik veroorsaak is deur die nalatigheid van die bestuurder van die
ongeïdentifiseerde voertuig en dat daar fisiese kontak was tussen daardie
voertuig en dié van die appellant.  Gevolglik het die hof dit nie nodig geag
om te beslis of regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) geldig is al dan nie.  Op appèl na die
Volle Hof van die Transvaalse Provinsiale Afdeling is daar bevind (1) dat
die ongeluk veroorsaak is deur die gesamentlike nalatigheid van die
bestuurder van die ongeïdentifiseerde voertuig en die respondent in die
verhouding 75% tot 25%; (2) dat daar nie fisiese kontak was tussen die
twee voertuie nie; en (3) dat regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) ultra vires is, met die
gevolg dat die MMF wel aanspreeklik is vir 75% van die respondent se
skade.  ‘n Gepaste bevel is gemaak na aanleiding van hierdie bevindings.
Die uitspraak van die Volle Hof is gerapporteer - sien Multilaterale
Motorvoertuigongelukkefonds v Prinsloo [1998] 3 ALL SA 310 (T).

Spesiale verlof is deur hierdie Hof aan die appellant verleen om in hoër
beroep te kom teen die bevinding dat regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) ultra vires is.
Die Wet is op 1 Junie 1989 goedgekeur en word (luidens artikel 8),
geag op 1 Mei 1989 in werking te getree het.  Die betrokke regulasies is
op 27 Oktober 1989 uitgevaardig met ingang van 1 Mei 1989.  Die Wet
sluit die regulasies in (artikel 1(i)).  Sekere wat hierdie appèl betref nie-
tersaaklike wysigings is later aan beide die Wet en die regulasies
aangebring.  Wat ookal die regsposisie was tussen 1 Mei 1989 en 27
Oktober 1989 toe daar geen regulasies bestaan het nie (wat nie in die
onderhawige appèl beslis hoef te word nie), was die Wet en regulasies
van krag toe die ongeluk plaasgevind het.
Die Wet gee statutêre regskrag aan die Ooreenkoms ter stigting van
die MMF (“die Ooreenkoms”) wat op 14 Februarie 1989 aangegaan  is

tussen verteenwoordigers van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika en die
destydse Republieke van Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda en Ciskei
(artikel 2(1)).  Die inleidende artikel tot die Ooreenkoms bepaal dat
“Die betaling van skadevergoeding vir sekere verlies of
skade wat onregmatig veroorsaak word deur die bestuur van
sekere motorvoertuie in die regsgebied van die
Kontrakterende Partye word na die datum van instelling van
die MMF gereël en behartig deur die MMF op ‘n
multilaterale grondslag volgens die bepalings en
voorwaardes van hierdie Ooreenkoms.”
Luidens artikel 2 van die Ooreenkoms is
“[d]ie MMF se taak . . die betaling van skadevergoeding vir
sekere verlies of skade veroorsaak deur die onregmatige
bestuur van sekere motorvoertuie in die regsgebied van sy
Lede.”
Artikel 13 van die Ooreenkoms gelees met artikel 3(c) maak
voorsiening vir die aanstelling van benoemde agente.  Die onderskeie
bevoegdhede en funksies van die MMF en ‘n benoemde agent met

betrekking tot eise word bepaal deur artikels 3(b) en 13(b)(i).  Kragtens
artikel 3(b) is die MMF belas met
“die ondersoek en skikking van eise, soos voorgeskryf, wat
ontstaan uit verlies of skade veroorsaak deur die bestuur van
‘n motorvoertuig waar die identiteit van nóg die eienaar nóg
die bestuurder daarvan vasgestel kan word”,
terwyl artikel 13(b)(i) ‘n benoemde agent met ‘n ooreenstemmende
bevoegdheid ten opsigte van enige eis bedoel in artikel 40 beklee in
gevalle waar die identiteit van óf die eienaar óf die bestuurder daarvan
vasgestel is.  Kortom, is die MMF en ‘n benoemde agent onderskeidelik
verantwoordelik vir die hantering van eise voortspruitend uit gevalle
waarby wat gerieflikheidshalwe na verwys sal word as ongeïdentifiseerde
en geïdentifiseerde voertuie betrokke is.
Ingevolge die woordomskrywingsbepaling van die Ooreenkoms
(artikel 1) beteken “voorskryf”, tensy uit die samehang anders blyk,

“voorskryf deur die Raad by wyse van ‘n riglyn”.  Dit is die betekenis wat
verleen moet word aan die woorde “soos voorgeskryf” in artikel 3(b)
aangesien die samehang nie op ‘n ander betekenis dui nie.  Na my mening
beteken dit nie soos voorgeskryf deur regulasie nie.
Artikel 40 van die Ooreenkoms bepaal die aanspreeklikheid van die
MMF en benoemde agente.  Dit lui soos volg:
“Die MMF of sy benoemde agent, na gelang van die geval,
is behoudens die bepalings van hierdie Ooreenkoms verplig
om enigeen wie ook al (in hierdie Ooreenkoms die derde
partye genoem) te vergoed vir verlies of skade wat die derde
party gely het as gevolg van-
(a)
enige liggaamlike besering van
homself;
(b)
die dood of liggaamlike besering
van iemand anders,
wat in die een sowel as die ander geval veroorsaak is deur
of voortvloei uit die bestuur van ‘n motorvoertuig deur wie
ook al op enige plek in die regsgebied van die Lede van die
MMF, indien die besering of dood te wyte is aan die
nalatigheid of ‘n ander onregmatige daad van die persoon

wat die motorvoertuig bestuur het (in hierdie Ooreenkoms
die bestuurder genoem) of van die eienaar van die
motorvoertuig of sy werknemer in die uitvoering van sy
plig.”
Artikel 40 is baie wyd in omvang.  Dit dek alle gevalle van verlies
of skade soos beoog wat gely is as gevolg van die nalatige bestuur van ‘n
voertuig op enige plek in die regsgebied van die lede van die MMF,
ongeag of die bestuurder of eienaar van die betrokke voertuig
geïdentifiseer kan word al dan nie (SA Eagle Insurance Co Ltd v
Pretorius 1998(2) SA 656 (SCA) op 660 H - 661 B).  Dit skep dus
aanspreeklikheid selfs in gevalle waar daar andersins weens die onvermoë
van ‘n eiser om ‘n verweerder te identifiseer geen praktiese remedie sou
wees nie.  Die artikel is dus volkome in ooreenstemming met wat nog
altyd beskou is as die algemene oogmerk van die Wetgewer in wetgewing
van hierdie aard, naamlik, om die wydste moontlike beskerming aan

persone te verleen wat verlies of skade gely het soos in die artikel beoog
(Aetna Insurance Co v Minister of Justice 1960(3) SA 273 (A) op 286 E -
F).  Die artikel stel geen vereiste van fisiese kontak as ‘n voorwaarde vir
aanspreeklikheid nie.  Dit is trouens gemene saak dat nêrens in die Wet
of die Ooreenkoms so ‘n vereiste voorkom nie, ondanks die feit dat artikel
48 van die Ooreenkoms uitdruklik voorsiening maak vir die uitsluiting van
aanspreeklikheid in sekere gevalle.  Artikel 40 sluit dus nie
aanspreeklikheid uit in die geval waar ‘n ongeïdentifiseerde voertuig nie
in fisiese kontak was met ‘n beseerde of ‘n oorledene, of die voertuig
waarin hy of sy gereis het nie.
Artikel 6 van die Wet magtig die Minister om regulasies uit te
vaardig “ten einde gevolg te gee aan ‘n bepaling van die Ooreenkoms
soos in die Republiek van toepassing” (my beklemtoning).  Dit magtig nie

die Minister om regulasies uit te vaardig buite die omvang en bestek van
die Ooreenkoms wat nie redelikerwys nodig is om die doel van artikel
6(1) te bereik nie.  Regulasies is ondergeskikte wetgewing voortvloeiend
uit ‘n gedelegeerde voorskrif.  ‘n Regulasie moet in die lig van die
magtigende Wet uitgelê word, nie andersom nie (Sekretaris van
Binnelandse Sake v Jawoodien 1969(3) SA 413 (A) op 423 E).  ‘n
Regulasie wat dus nie gevolg gee aan ‘n bepaling van die Ooreenkoms
nie, is ultra vires (Mbatha v Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund
1997(3) SA 713 (SCA) op 718 C).
Die bepaling in regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) dat, as voorvereiste vir
aanspreeklikheid aan die kant van die MMF, daar in die geval van ‘n
ongeïdentifiseerde voertuig fisiese kontak moet wees, vind, soos reeds
aangedui, nie weerklank in óf die Wet óf die Ooreenkoms nie.  Dit stel ‘n

beperking op aanspreeklikheid wat onbestaanbaar is met die wye
betekenis van artikel 40 van die Ooreenkoms en wat die trefwydte
daarvan verminder.  Dit gee nie gevolg aan artikel 40 of enige ander
bepaling van die Ooreenkoms nie; die teenoorgestelde is eerder waar (vgl
S v Grindrod Transport (Pty) Ltd and Others 1980(3) SA 978 (N) op 983
F - G).  Die Minister se bevoegdheid kragtens artikel 6(1) van die Wet is
‘n suiwer regulerende bevoegdheid.  ‘n Verbod wat volgens so ‘n
bevoegdheid opgelê word, is ongeldig (R v Williams 1914 AD 460 op 465
en 467; S v Perumal 1977(1) SA 526 (N)).  Hierdie beginsel behoort
eweneens te geld waar ‘n reg ontneem word as gevolg van ‘n
ongemagtigde beperking van aanspreeklikheid, soos in die onderhawige
geval.  Ek stem ook saam met die Hof a quo dat “[a]rtikel 6 van die Wet
dui nie die bedoeling aan tot die verleen van die bevoegdheid om

aanspreeklikheidsuitsluiting by wyse van regulasie neer te lê nie “(sien die
gerapporteerde uitspraak op 314 e - f).  Die plaas van ‘n andersins
ongemagtigde beperking op die MMF se aanspreeklikheid is ook nie
redelikerwyse diensbaar (reasonably incidental) aan die Minister se
verleende bevoegdhede nie.  Gevolglik het die Hof a quo myns insiens
tereg bevind dat regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) ultra vires is.
Die Wet se voorgangers was Wet 29 van 1942, Wet 56 van 1972
en Wet 84 van 1986.  Sedert 1966, kragtens regulasies onder die
onderskeie Wette uitgevaardig, was aanspreeklikheid in die geval van ‘n
ongeïdentifiseerde voertuig uitgesluit waar daar nie fisiese kontak was nie.
Dieselfde situasie geld wat betref die Wet se opvolger, Wet 56 van 1996.
Fisiese kontak is aanvaar as ‘n voorvereiste vir aanspreeklikheid in
Terblanche v Minister van Vervoer en ‘n Ander 1977(3) SA 462 (T) op

470 C (waar Wet 56 van 1972 gegeld het) en Khumalo v Multilateral
Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund [1997] 2 ALL SA 341 (N) (wat beslis is
aan die hand van die Wet en regulasies wat hier ter sprake is, maar waar
die regsgeldigheid van regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) klaarblyklik nie bevraagteken
is nie).  Daar bestaan wel grondige redes vir die vereiste van “fisiese
kontak” - sien Mbatha se saak (supra) op 718 H - J en Khumalo se saak
op 346 f - i.
Ek sal veronderstel, sonder om die punt te beslis, dat vanweë die
samestelling en bewoording van die vorige en huidige wetgewing, fisiese
kontak ‘n geldige voorvereiste was en is vir die MMF en sy voorgangers
en opvolger se aanspreeklikheid in die geval van ‘n ongeluk waarin ‘n
ongeïdentifiseerde voertuig betrokke was.  Die betrokke regulasies wat
sodanige vereiste gestel het, was en is in ooreenstemming eerder as in

stryd  met die magtigende bepalings en dus intra vires.  Die vraag
ontstaan dan of, gesien die Wet in sy historiese perspektief, dit nie
deurgaans die Wetgewer se bedoeling was om aanspreeklikheid in so ‘n
geval uit te sluit nie? As dit die geval is, kom daar nie ‘n onbedoelde
leemte voor nie wat moontlike regstelling verg?
Dit is twyfelagtig of daar tot so ‘n gevolgtrekking gekom kan word.
Die Wet verskil wesenlik in samestelling en bewoording van sy
voorgangers en opvolger.  Soos Daniels:  MMF - The Practitioner’s
Guide, in sy inleiding met betrekking tot die Wet (op A - 7) dit stel:
“The most significant feature of the Act is the fact that,
unlike previous legislation, it is not directly concerned with
so-called third party compensation, in the sense that it does
not contain terms and conditions relating to such claims, nor
does it prescribe procedures in regard thereto.”
In teenstelling met vorige wetgewing gee die Wet regskrag aan die

Ooreenkoms waarvolgens die MMF gestig is.  Dit is die Ooreenkoms,
eerder as die Wet, wat die aanspreeklikheid en administasie van die MMF
reguleer en voorskrifte vir die hantering van eise neerlê.  Daarbenewens
is die Ooreenkoms een, soos reeds aangedui, waarby ander destydse lande
betrokke was, wat nie die geval was wat betref die ander wetgewing nie.
Die redelike moontlikheid kan nie uitgesluit word nie dat die partye tot die
Ooreenkoms voorstanders was van wyer aanspreeklikheid as voorheen en
dat die Wetgewer dit destyds so aanvaar het.  Dit help egter nie om te
spekuleer waarom die Wet en die Ooreenkoms bewoord is soos wel die
geval is nie. Die feit bly staan dat volgens geykte beginsels die Wetgewer
se bedoeling in die eerste instansie afgelei moet  word van die bewoording
van die Wet en die Ooreenkoms.  Daarvolgens is die Wetgewer se
bedoeling duidelik en ondubbelsinnig en regulasie 3(1)(a)(v), wat in

botsing daarmee is, ultra vires.  Dit synde so, is dit in iedere geval nie
geoorloof om op die voorafgaande (of latere) wetgewing te let nie (vgl R
v von Zell (2) 1953(4) SA 552 (A) op 558 F; Ebrahim v Minister of the
Interior 1977(1) SA 665 (A) op 680 A - D).
Daar steek myns insiens niks in die appellant se betoog nie dat
indien regulasie 3(1)(a)(v) ultra vires is dieselfde noodwendig geld vir
regulasie 3(1)(a)(i) tot (iv).  Regulasie 3(1)(a)(i) is eintlik oorbodig
aangesien dit neerkom op ‘n herhaling van wat in artikel 40 van die
Ooreenkoms voorkom.  Regulasie 3(1)(a)(ii) tot (iv) is prosesregtelik van
aard en het betrekking op die voorlegging en voortsetting van eise (vgl
Mbatha se saak (supra) op 718 F), nie op die beperking van
aanspreeklikheid nie.  As sodanig blyk dit gevolg te gee aan die
Ooreenkoms.  Dit is egter ook nie nodig om hieroor uitsluitsel te gee nie.

Na my mening is daar niks in die beslissing in Mbatha se saak wat
afbreuk doen aan die gevolgtrekkings waartoe ek geraak het nie.
Die partye was dit eens dat die koste van twee advokate op appèl
toegelaat behoort te word.  Na oorweging blyk hierdie ‘n gepaste geval
vir so ‘n bevel te wees.
Die appèl word van die hand gewys met koste, insluitende die koste
van twee advokate.

DATE OF DELIVERY    19 March 1999

Execution - Immovable Property - ADays@ in Rule 46 (7) (c).

J U D G M E N T

/HOWIE JA:. . .

HOWIE JA:
[1] 
The  home of appellant and his ex-wife was the subject of a
sale in execution at the instance of the first respondent bank.   The sale
was arranged for Friday 22 April 1994.   In terms of rule 46 (7) (c) of the
Uniform Rules as it read then (it has since been amended) the sale had to
be advertised in locally circulating newspapers

Anot less than three days and not more than five days@

before the sale date.   It was advertised on the preceding Friday.   The
sale took place and the property was sold.
[2] 
If Adays@ in the subrule meant  calendar days then the
advertisements were published more than five days before the sale, in
conflict  with the requirement in question.   If Adays@meant Acourt days@,
as defined in rule 1, then the sale was advertised on the fifth preceding
court day in compliance with  the requirement concerned.
[3] 
Contending for non-compliance, appellant applied in the

High Court at Johannesburg for orders i a setting aside the sale as invalid
and affording concomitant relief.   The Court (Tuchten AJ) found that the
advertisements failed to comply with  subrule (7)(c) but held that this did
not invalidate the sale.   For that and other reasons the application was
dismissed.  With the learned Judge=s leave appellant contests such
dismissal.
[4] 
If there was compliance with the subrule then  the appeal
must fail.
[5] 
In holding that there was non-compliance with subrule
(7)(c) the Court below relied on the decision in First Consolidated
Leasing Corporation Ltd. v Theron 1974 (4) SA 244 (T), preferring it to
the decision in Röntgen v Reichenberg 1984 (2) SA 181 (W).   In the
former case, which dealt with subrule (7)(d), Eloff J held that the word
Adays@ in that paragraph meant calendar days.  In the Röntgen case,
concerning subrule (7)(c), it was decided by Coetzee J that Adays@ meant
court days.

[6] 
Rule 1 is the definition provision in the Rules or, to use a
term sometimes employed, the interpretation provision.  It says, as it did
at the relevant time:

AIn these rules and attached forms unless the context
otherwise indicates C
. . .
>court day= shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or
Public Holiday, and only court days shall be included in the
computation of any time expressed in days prescribed by these
rules or fixed by any order of court . . .@
[7] 
Rule 46 is entitled AExecution - Immovables@ and it is
appropriate for present purposes to quote the relevant provisions as they
read in 1994:

A
(1)  A writ of execution against immovable property
shall contain a full description of the nature and situation
(including the address) of the immovable property to enable
it to be traced and identified by the sheriff . . .
(2)  An attachment shall be made by the sheriff of the
district in which the property is situate or by the sheriff of
the district in which the office of the registrar of deeds or

other officer charged with the registration of such property
is situate, upon a writ as near as may be in accordance with
Form 20 of the First Schedule.
(3)  The mode of attachment of immovable property
shall be by notice in writing by the sheriff served upon the
owner thereof, and upon the registrar of deeds or other
officer charged with the registration of such immovable
property . . .
(4) After attachment, any sale in execution shall take
place in the district in which the attached property is situate
and be conducted by the sheriff of such district . . .
. . .
(7)
(a) The sheriff shall appoint a day and
place for the sale of such property, such
day being, except by special leave of a
magistrate, not less than one month
after
service
of
the
notice
of
attachment.

(b) The execution creditor shall, after
consultation with the sheriff, prepare a notice
of sale containing a short description of the
property, its situation and street number, if
any, the time and place for the holding of the
sale and the fact that the conditions may be
inspected at the office of the sheriff, and he
shall furnish the sheriff with as many copies
of the notice as the latter may require.

(c) The deputy sheriff shall indicate two
suitable  newspapers (whenever possible one
in each of the official languages) circulating in

the district in which the property is situated
and require the execution creditor to publish
the said notice once in each of the said
newspapers, not less than three days and not
more than five days and in the Government
Gazette not later than two weeks before the
date appointed for the sale and to furnish him,
not later than the day prior to the date of the
sale, with one copy of each of the said
newspapers and with the number of the
Gazette in which the notice appeared.

(d) Not less than ten days prior to the date of
the sale, the sheriff shall forward by registered
post a copy of the notice of sale referred to in
paragraph (b) above to every judgment
creditor who had caused the said immovable
property to be attached and to every
mortgagee thereof whose address is known.

(e) Not less than ten days prior to the date of
the sale, the sheriff shall affix one copy of the
notice on the notice-board of the magistrate=s
court of the district in which the property is
situate, or if the property be situate in the
district in which the court out of which the
writ issued is situate, then on the notice-board
of such  court, and one copy at or as near as
may be to the place where the said sale is
actually to take place.

(8)
(a) The conditions of sale shall, not less than
20 days prior to the date of the sale, be
prepared by the execution creditor as near as
may be in accordance with Form 21 of the
First Schedule, and the said conditions shall
be submitted to the sheriff to settle them.  The
execution creditor shall thereafter supply the

sheriff with two copies of the conditions of
sale, one of which shall lie for inspection by
interested parties at his office.

(b) Any interested party may, not less than 10
days prior to the date of the sale, upon twenty-
four hours= notice to the execution creditor
and the bondholders apply to the magistrate of
the district in which the property is to be sold
for any modification of the conditions of sale
and the magistrate may make such order
thereon, including an order as to costs, as to
him may seem meet.

. . .

(11) If the purchaser fails to carry out any of his
obligations under the conditions of sale the sale may be
cancelled by a judge summarily on the report of the sheriff
after due notice to the purchaser, and the property may
again be put up for sale, and the purchaser shall be
responsible for any loss sustained by reason  of his default,
which loss may, on the application of any aggrieved
creditor whose name appears on the sheriff=s distribution
account, be recovered from him under judgment of the
judge pronounced summarily on a written report by the
sheriff, after such purchaser shall have received notice in
writing that such report will be  laid before the judge for
such purpose; and, if he is already in possession of the
property, the sheriff may, on 10 days= notice, apply to a
judge for an order ejecting him or any person claiming to

hold under him therefrom.
. . .
. . .
(14) (a) The sheriff shall not pay out to the creditor
the purchase money until transfer has been
given to the purchaser, but upon receipt
thereof he shall forthwith pay into the deposit
account of the magistrate of the district all
moneys received in respect of the purchase
price.

(b) The sheriff shall as soon as possible after
the sale prepare in order of preference, as
hereinafter provided, a plan of distribution of
the proceeds and shall forward a copy of such
plan to the registrar of the court.  Immediately
thereafter the sheriff shall give notice by
registered post to all parties who have lodged
writs and to the execution debtor that the plan
will lie for inspection for 15 days from a date
mentioned at his office and at the office of the
registrar, and unless such parties shall signify,
in writing, their agreement to the plan, such
plan shall so lie  for inspection.

(c) After deduction from the proceeds of the

costs and charges of execution, the following
shall be the order of preference:
(i)
the claims of preferent
creditors
ranking
in
priority in their legal order
of
preference;
and
thereafter
(ii)
the
claims
of
other
creditors whose writs have
been lodged with the
sheriff
in
order
of
preference appearing from
sections ninety-six and
ninety-nine
to
one
hundred
and
three
(inclusive)
of
the
Insolvency Act, 1936 (Act
No 24 of 1936) as
amended.

(d) Any interested person objecting to such
plan shall, within five days of the expiry of the
period referred to in paragraph (b) of this sub-
rule give notice in writing to the sheriff and all
other interested persons of the particulars of
his objection and shall bring such objection
before a judge for review on 10 days= notice to
the sheriff and the said persons.
(e)   The judge on review shall hear and
determine the matter in dispute and
may amend or confirm the plan of
distribution or may make such order

including an order as to costs as to him
seems meet.
(f) If -
(i)
no objection be lodged to such
plan, or
(ii)
the interested parties signify their
concurrence therein, or
(iii)
the plan is confirmed or amended
on review,
the magistrate shall, on production of a
certificate from the conveyancer that transfer
has been given to the purchaser and on the
request of the sheriff, pay out in accordance
with the plan of distribution.  If the address of
a payee is not known the amount due to him
shall be paid into the Guardian=s Fund
established under any law relating to the
administration of estates.

. . .

[8] By  amendment in 1996 a further  subrule  was added, reading
as follows:

A(16) In this rule, the word >days= shall have the same
meaning as >court days= as defined in rule 1 of the Rules.@

That can,  of course, have no bearing on the present issue and  the

ensuing discussion proceeds on the basis of  the pre-amendment position.

[9] 
The relevant reasoning in the First Consolidated Leasing
case is contained in the following passage (at 246 in fine):
ANow it is true that in Rule 1 which defines Acourt days@
it is said that only court days shall be included in the
computation of the number of days for which the Rules
make provision, but that definition is subject to the context
in which the word Adays@ is used.   I think that in the
context of Rule 46 (7)(d) calendar days were intended and
not court days.  Rule 46 has nothing to do with procedural
steps connected with a law-suit, and the considerations
which prompted the draftsman of the Rules to exclude
Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays in computing the
number of days allowed for procedural steps in litigation,
could not have applied to the steps required to be taken
when property is sold in execution.@

[10] That statement was endorsed by Mynhardt J in the
unreported case of Manrim (Pty) Ltd and Another v Bank of Lisbon
International and Others (Transvaal Provincial Division case 17464/95,
judgment having been delivered on 27 September 1995).  In elaborating
upon the above-quoted reasons in the First Consolidated Leasing case,

Mynhardt J considered that the expressions Aone month@ in subrule (7)(a)
and Atwo weeks@ in subrule (7)(c) signified C
A[t]he clear intention of the rule . . .  that in this particular
instance there is no need to read the reference to  days as a
reference to court days as one ordinarily would do in the
context of other rules . . .@ (At 4 of the typed judgment).

[11] The Court below agreed with the reasoning of Eloff J and
Mynhardt J and added that it was unlikely that the legislature would in
the same subrule have provided for the computation of time by reference
to different standards.
[12] By contrast, Coetzee J held in Röntgen (at 185 G - H) that
there was nothing in Rule 46 which in any way indicated a meaning of
Adays@ other than court days and that there was therefore no contextual
basis for departing from the defined meaning.   To reach that conclusion
the learned Judge commenced with one of the Oxford English Dictionary
meanings of Acontext@.   It is:  Athe parts which immediately precede or
follow any particular passage or >text= and determine its meaning@.   On

the strength of this he continued (at 184 H) C

AIn my view this time-honoured phrase which appears in
the definition sections of legislation (>unless the context
otherwise indicates=) means that another meaning is to be
given to the particular word or phrase so defined only if the
parts which precede or follow that particular word or phrase
indicate that it is used in a different sense or with a different
meaning.   One therefore has to examine the language used
in the particular sections to determine whether the defined
word is used clearly in a different sense in any related
passage which  precedes or follows the one that falls to be
interpreted and, if so, whether contextually the same
meaning is intended in the passage in question.@

However, the learned Judge then proceeded (at 185 A - G) to draw, and
enlarge upon, what he considered was a crucial and self-evident
distinction between language and context on the one hand and legislative
intention on the other.   The case before him, so he considered, only
concerned the former because

A(w)hen one deals with a word, as defined, in the same Act,

it becomes a matter of language and context, in its strict
sense.   There is then very little scope for legislative
intention as an aid to interpretation as it is normally applied
in the construction of statutes, because in that very piece of
legislation its meaning is irrebuttably fixed.   Only if the
context in a particular passage or section of that Act
contradicts that meaning, may it be departed from for the
purpose of that section@  (At 185 F - G).

Finally, to emphasise his view of the minimal role of legislative intention
in the case before him, Coetzee J viewed Eloff J=s observation that rule
46 had nothing to do with procedural steps in litigation as irrelevant,
being speculation about legislative intention and unconnected with
context (at l85 H).
[13] These, then, are the competing dicta which must be
considered in deciding the essential issue.
[14] In my view, with due respect, the reasoning and the
conclusion in First Consolidated Leasing were wrong.   In the first place,
it is not correct that the rule has nothing to do with procedural steps

connected with a law suit.   Quite plainly the rule deals with procedural
matters and execution is undoubtedly connected with litigation.   It is the
process whereby the successful litigant seeks to exact payment of the
judgment debt in which the litigation has culminated.   Not only that.
Subrules (11) and (14) clearly provide for proceedings before a judge, in
connection with which time limits are set which are stated in days, and
which proceedings can terminate in orders for various forms of relief.
This being so, there is as much reason for Adays@ in those subrules to
mean court days as there is in the rules dealing with litigation.
[15] Secondly, even assuming that the rule applies only to
matters unconnected with litigation,  that cannot justify the adoption of a
meaning of Adays@ other than the defined meaning.   The definition is
expressly to apply to Aany time. . . prescribed by these rules@ i e whether
the rules pertain to litigation or not.
[16] Thirdly, the defined meaning has to apply also to periods
fixed in days Aby any order of court@.   Therefore Adays@ in any such

period laid down by an order under subrule (11) will obviously have to
mean court days.   If  Eloff J were right,  Adays@ would then have
different meanings in one and the same  rule depending on which subrule
was under consideration.   That cannot have been the drafter=s intention.
It would lead to confusion and uncertainty.
[17] In the fourth instance, there is no justification for the view
expressed by Eloff J that the reason for stipulating court days in relation
to litigation cannot also apply to execution.   If Adays@ mean calendar
days then the minimum three  day period in subrule (7) (c) could include
a long weekend occasioned by a public holiday.   Interested parties,
particularly the judgment debtor and potential purchasers, would have no
business days in which to try to make necessary financial arrangements.
Here, once again, is as much reason for Adays@ to mean court days as
there is in the rules concerning litigation.
[18] Finally, and most importantly, it is not enough to warrant
departure from the defined meaning that the subject matter of the rule or

section under examination differs from the subject matter of provisions
in which the defined meaning clearly does apply.   That is not the test.
There is a line of cases, including decisions of this Court, in which the
true approach is stated.   The inference is compelling that none of them
was drawn to the Court=s attention in either the First Consolidated
Leasing case or in the Röntgen matter.   They are collected in Canca v
Mount Frere Municipality 1984 (2) SA 830 (TkSC) at 832 B - G in a
passage which in my opinion sets out the position correctly.   It reads:
AThe question whether a word in a particular section of a
statute should be given its statutory definition or the
ordinary meaning has come up for decision in a number of
cases.   Mr Findlay, for respondent, cites as an example the
case of Limbada v Principal Immigration Officer 1933
NPD 146 at 150, and amongst the cases to which I have
also had reference are Town Council of Springs v Moosa
and Another 1929 AD 401 at 417; Commissioner of
Customs and Excise and Another v Officer Designated
under Act 24 of 1936, s 39 (2) and Another N O 1958 (1)
SA 86 (W) at 88; Commissioner for Inland Revenue v

Simpson 1949 (4) SA 678 (A) at 692 and Brown v Cape
Divisional Council and Another 1979 (1) SA 589 (A) at
600.   In some of these cases the Court was concerned with
a definition section which expressly provided (as here) that
the definition should be applied Aunless inconsistent with
the context@, and in others the definition section did not
contain those qualifying words.   In all cases, however, the
same basic approach was adopted, albeit that such approach
was formulated in different ways.   Strictly the Acontext@ of
a word or passage in a text would consist of Athe parts
which immediately precede or follow@ that word or passage
(see in this regard the definition of Acontext@ in the Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary) but in no case to which I have
had reference did the Court confine itself to so narrow an
examination of the Act in determining the question in issue.
The principle which emerges is that the statutory
definition should prevail unless it appears that the
Legislature intended otherwise and, in deciding whether the
Legislature so intended, the Court has generally asked itself
whether the application of the statutory definition would
result in such injustice or incongruity or absurdity as to lead
to the conclusion that the Legislature could never have
intended the statutory definition to apply.@

[19] Adopting the correct test,  it is plain that the application of

the defined meaning of Adays@ in rule 46 cannot lead to any injustice,
incongruity or absurdity.   Counsel for appellant properly conceded as
much.   It is therefore that meaning which must govern.   The
consequence is that the newspaper publications in the present case
complied with the subrule.   The appeal must accordingly fail.
[20] Although, therefore,   the conclusion in the Röntgen case
was correct,    it is nevertheless necessary to say two things about the
reasoning underlying it.   The above-quoted passage at 184 H in that
judgment, relying as it does on the cited dictionary definition of
Acontext@, might tend to convey that Acontext@ is confined to parts of a
legislative provision which immediately precede and follow the
particular passage under examination.   If that was what the learned
Judge did mean then, with respect, he defined context too narrowly.
AContext@  includes the entire enactment in which the word or words in
contention appear: Re Evans [1891] 1 QB 143 and in its widest sense
would include enactments in pari materia and the situation, or

Amischief@, sought to be remedied: Attorney-General v Prince Ernest
Augustus of Hanover, [1957] AC 436 (HL), [1957] 1 All ER 49.   That is
the first point.  The second is that there is no justification for the
distinction, so heavily relied on by the learned Judge, between linguistic
context and legislative intention.   The moment one has to analyse
context in order to determine whether a meaning is to be given which
differs from the defined meaning one is immediately engaged in
ascertaining legislative intention.   One remains so engaged until the
interpretation process is concluded.   It is only concluded when
legislative intention is established.   As remarked by E Cameron in
LAWSA, 27, 207 par 229:
A. . . context does no more than reflect legislative meaning
which in turn is capable of being expressed only through
words in context@.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.

1991  - Sec 30 (1) of the Companies Act, 61 of 1973
JUDGMENT

OLIVIER JA
[1] This is an appeal against a judgment of CASSIM AJ in an opposed
application in the High Court of South Africa, Witwatersrand Local Division, leave
to appeal having been granted by the court a quo.  The appeal raises the question
whether interested parties, wishing to oppose an application by the holder of mineral
rights for a mining licence in terms of sec 9 of the Minerals Act 50 of 1991 (‘the
Act’), are entitled to raise environmental objections and be heard by the first
appellant, who is the official designated to grant or refuse such licence (‘the
Director’).   In the present case, the Director, taking the view that consideration of
such objections would be premature at that stage, refused the respondents a hearing.
He was successfully taken on review.  The appeal is aimed at reversing the outcome
of that review.
[2] The second appellant (‘Sasol Mining’) is the holder of extensive mineral
rights, including those in respect of an area comprising three farms in the Sasolburg
district.  The farms front on the Vaal River.
[3] During May 1996 Sasol Mining was in urgent need of extending its coal
mining activities to the area in question. It was established that the only feasible

manner of mining for coal in that area was by open-cast mining.  The envisaged
mining site is in the north-west part of the area and very close to the southern bank
of the Vaal River.  Sasol Mining then applied to the Director for a mining licence in
terms of sec 9 of the Act.
[4] The first  respondent (‘Save’) is an unincorporated association.  Its members
are concerned people who own property and live along the Vaal River.   Its object,
according to its written constitution, is to assist its members to protect and maintain
the environmental integrity of the Vaal River and its environs for current and future
generations with specific focus on the area between the Letaba Weir and the Barrage
- i.e. precisely the area in the immediate vicinity of the proposed open- cast mine.
The other respondents are either members of Save or property owners in the affected
area. All the respondents are united in their opposition to the development and
exploitation of the coal reserves by open-cast mining in the area under discussion.
Their concerns are primarily of an environmental nature.
[5] In July 1996, while Sasol Mining’s application was still under consideration
by the Director, Save’s attorney, Mr Barnard, raised the contention that Save is
entitled to be heard in opposing the said application.  Towards the end of February
1997 and again in March 1997, the Director informed Barnard that he was not

obliged to hear Save at that stage and that he was not prepared to do so. On 22 May
1997 the Director issued a mining licence to Sasol Mining in respect of the
envisaged open-cast mine.
[6] The environmental concerns raised by the respondents can be summarised
as follows :
(a)
The destruction of the Rietspruit wetland.
This wetland occurs inter alia in the area under discussion.  It covers
approximately one thousand hectares.  The wetland in its present state
annually filters and purifies naturally in excess of two million cubic metres of
improved quality water into the Vaal Barrage.  This large volume of water
makes a valuable contribution to water quality in the Vaal Barrage.  It is
alleged that the wetland will be at least partially destroyed by the envisaged
open-cast mining.  It is further alleged that the eventual replacement of the
overburden after the mine has been worked out would not restore the wetland
because the upper layer of hydric soil will have been replaced by
undifferentiated soils without water storage capabilities.  The affected
wetland will thus be permanently destroyed.  Furthermore, removal of the
overburden  -  to reach the coal seams  -  will result in natural seepage water
making contact with iron pyrites in the exposed coal seams. This will create

weak sulphuric acid solutions and leaching of acid water into the Vaal
Barrage is likely.
(b)
The threat to fauna and flora.
The proposed mining area supports some two hundred and fifty-four
bird species and some forty-four endemic species of mammals.  In addition,
some thirty-three species of reptiles and amphibians are likely to occur in the
area. Some fifteen plant taxa occurring in the area, including the provincial
flower, are listed in the Free State’s Protected Plants Ordinance.
Furthermore, various red data plants (i.e. plants endangered by or threatened
with extinction) have been identified.
(c)
Pollution.
The predicted constant noise, light, dust and water pollution resulting from
the proposed strip mine will totally destroy the “sense of place” of the
wetland and the associated Cloudy Creek.  Thus the spiritual, aesthetic and
therapeutic qualities associated with this area will also be eliminated.
(d)
Loss of water quality.
The Vaal Barrage is the only water body of reasonable quality and free of
bilharzia serving the recreational needs of the Gauteng metropolitan populace.
A substantial infrastructure to support diversified nature-related recreational
activities has been developed in the Vaal River area.  The predicted

environmental degradation leading to reduced water quality and aesthetic
values resulting from the envisaged twenty years of open-cast mining on the
banks of the Vaal Barrage would be likely to destroy a major portion of such
activities with a concomitant destruction of small business enterprises and
loss of job opportunities.
(e)
Decreased value of properties.
There are indications, so it was finally alleged, that mere rumours of the
commencement of open-cast mining in the area under discussion have already
adversely affected property values and the investor.   Concerns are expressed
that the operation of the proposed open-cast mine will have a permanent
negative effect on the property market in the vicinity, with a serious
diminution of property values.
Save’s legality
[7] The last mentioned concern raised by Save, i.e. the possible diminution of
property values caused by the said mining, gave rise to a point in limine being
advanced by Sasol Mining.  It is that Save, which has more than 20 members and
is not registered as a company, is an illegal association.   Reliance was placed on sec
30 (1) of the Companies Act,  61 of 1973.  It reads :

“No company, association, syndicate or partnership consisting
of more than twenty persons shall be permitted or formed in the
Republic for the purpose of carrying on any business that has for
its object the acquisition of gain by the company, association,
syndicate or partnership, or by the individual members thereof,
unless it is registered as a company under this Act, or is formed
in pursuance of some other law or was before the thirty-first day
of May, 1962, formed in pursuance of Letters Patent or Royal
Charter.”
The critical question is whether Save,  in the words of sec 30 (1), exists for
the purpose of  “... carrying on any business that has for its object the acquisition of
gain ...”  by the association or its members as individuals.
[8] The prohibition contained in sec 30 (1) should be kept within its proper
bounds.  The underlying purpose of the prohibition in our country, as in England, is
to prevent  mischief arising from trading undertakings being carried out by large
fluctuating bodies so that persons dealing with them do not know with whom they
are contracting (see Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 247 (CA) at 273;  Mitchell’s
Plain Town Centre Merchants Association  v  McLeod 1996 (4) SA 159 (A) at 169
I - 170 B).  On the facts before us it cannot be said that Save was trading or carrying
on a business with the object of the acquisition of gain.  Consequently, the objection
cannot be upheld.
The audi alteram partem rule (‘audi - rule’) in the present case.

[9] The respondents, contending that the rule should have been applied by the
Director, argued as follows:
(a)
The rule comes into operation whenever a statute empowers a public
official or body to do an act or give a decision prejudicially affecting a person
in his or her liberty or property or existing rights or interests, or whenever
such a person has a legitimate expectation of a hearing, unless the statute
expressly or by necessary implication indicates the contrary, or unless there
are exceptional circumstances which would justify a court in not giving effect
to it (see Du Preez and Another v Truth and Reconciliation Commission
1997 (3) SA 204 (A) at 231 C - F).
(b)
The primary substantive rights or interests on which the respondents
rely (and which according to them would be affected prejudicially by an
adverse decision of the Director) are the constitutional rights to the
environment (see sec 24 of the 1996 Constitution).
(c)
The audi - rule is neither expressly nor by necessary implication
excluded by the Act, nor are there any considerations of public policy
militating against the application of the rule.
[10]     The appellants contend that in the present case  the rule is excluded by

necessary implication.  Their arguments can be summarised as follows.  I shall at the
same time state my views in respect of each contention.
Exclusion by virtue of the provisions of sec 9 of the Act.
[11] It was argued that sec 9 is peremptory.  It provides that the Director
shall issue the mining authorisation if he is satisfied :
“(a)
with the manner in which and scale on which the applicant
intends to mine the mineral concerned optimally under such
mining authorization;
(b)
with the manner in which such applicant intends to
rehabilitate disturbances of the surface which may be
caused by his mining operations;
(c)
that such applicant has the ability and can make the necessary
provision to mine such mineral optimally and to rehabilitate such
disturbances of the surface; and
(d)
that the mineral concerned in respect of which a mining permit is
to be issued  -

(i)
occurs in limited quantities in or on the land or in tailings, as the
case may be, comprising the subject of the application;  or
(ii)
will be mined on a limited scale;  and
(iii)
will be mined on a temporary basis; or
(e)
that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the mineral

concerned in respect of which a mining licence is to be issued  -

(i)
occurs in more than limited quantities in or on the land or in tailings,
as the case may be, comprising the subject of the application; or
(ii)
will be mined on a larger than limited scale; and
(iii)
will be mined for a longer period than two years.”
[12] Counsel for the Director conceded that the audi - rule does apply to
paragraphs (a) to (e) of sec 9 (3), but then strictly within the ambit of these
paragraphs, which state requirements that he termed “jurisdictional facts”.  These
paragraphs, so he argued, amount to a numerus clausus, exhaustively defining and
limiting the discretionary power of the Director and excluding by necessary
implication the application of the audi - rule when the objection sought to be raised
is based solely upon environmental concerns.
[13] It is clear, however, that on a proper construction of paragraphs (a) to (e) of
sec 9 (3), at least some of the matters therein referred to involve environmental
issues.  For example, paragraph (b) requires an enquiry into the manner in which an
applicant intends to rehabilitate disturbances to the surfaces which may be caused
by the mining operations.  This provision requires the Director to enquire into the
nature and extent of the terrain which would be violated by the relevant mining
operations, the effect of such violation and how the terrain could and should be
rehabilitated.  In casu, he would have to take into account the alleged likelihood of
damage to the Rietspruit wetland and the question if, and to what extent, the wetland

could be rehabilitated.   These are environmental matters about which the
respondents have legitimate concerns.  The Director would therefore have to give
them an opportunity to be heard at that stage unless there are other provisions of the
Act which require them to defer raising their environmental concerns until some
other time.  Appellants submitted that such is indeed the case.  I will consider this
argument at a later stage.
[14] Counsel for Sasol Mining, on the other hand, was not prepared to concede
that the audi -rule applies to paragraphs (a) to (e) of sec 9 (3) at all.  Instead he
contended that the fact that the legislature enumerated the so-called “jurisdictional
facts” in sec 9 (3) (which, in counsel’s submission, do not include the consideration
of environmental matters), indicates, by necessary implication, a total exclusion of
the audi - rule.
[15]   The  argument is, in my view, fallacious.  We must ask ourselves : are we to
infer that it was the intention of parliament to exclude a fundamental principle such
as the audi - rule merely because the section under discussion has enumerated
certain factors which the Director must take into account in exercising his
discretion?  If that were the case the audi - rule would be excluded in virtually every
instance where some factors which an official has to take into account are

enumerated.  Such an approach would emasculate the principles of natural justice.
No rights are violated by a decision in terms of sec 9.
[16] The next argument advanced by the appellants runs like this  :
The mere issuing of a mining licence by the Director in terms of sec 9 of the Act can
have no tangible, physical effect on the environment.  For this reason no rights are
infringed and there is no case for a hearing.  Only when the environmental
management programme has been approved in accordance with sec 39 can mining
commence; and only then is there the possibility that rights may be infringed, and
only then is there a case for a hearing.  In the present matter the Director has not
approved an environmental management programme in terms of sec 39, and so, it
is argued by the appellants, the respondents have no right infringed or in jeopardy,
and have consequently no claim to a hearing.

[17] The argument cannot be sustained.  The issue of a licence in terms of
sec 9 enables the holder to proceed with the preparation of an environmental
management programme, which, if approved, will enable him to commence mining
operations.  Without the sec 9 licence he cannot seek such approval.  The granting
of the sec 9 licence opens the door to the licensee and sets in motion a chain of
events which can, and in the ordinary course of events might well, lead to the

commencement of  mining operations.  It is settled law that a mere preliminary
decision can have serious consequences in particular cases, inter alia where it lays
“ ... the necessary foundation for a possible decision ...” which may have grave
results.  In such a case the audi-rule applies to the consideration of the preliminary
decision (see Van Wyk N O v Van der Merwe 1957 (1) SA 181 (A) at 188 B - 189
A.).   In my view this is such a case.
The audi - rule should only be applied at the sec 39 stage.
[18] It was also argued on behalf of the appellants that because the audi-
rule would in any case be applied at the sec 39 stage, there was no need for the
application of the rule at the sec 9 stage.  In fact, so it was argued, to apply the rule
at both stages would amount to an unnecessary and costly duplication.
[19] This argument confuses the different objects of sec 9 and sec 39.  At
the sec 9 stage the basic issue is whether a mining licence should be granted or not;
at the sec 39 stage what is under consideration is the environmental management
programme. What is more, the granting of a sec 9 licence enables the holder to apply
to the Director to be exempted from the obligation to submit an environmental
management programme (see sec 39 (2) (a)).   It also enables the Director to grant
temporary authorisation for mining to commence, pending the approval of an

environmental management programme (sec 39 (4)).  Whether or not the Director
would have to afford an objector a hearing before doing either is unnecessary to
decide.  What matters is that, at the very least, the granting of a licence in terms of
sec 9 empowers the holder to make such applications and thereby subject an
objector to potential jeopardy in those respects.  It follows that a hearing in terms
of sec 39  may not address the appellants’ basic objection  to the manner of mining,
and may never take place or only take place after mining has already commenced.
[20] In the result, I am of the view that the audi-rule applies when application for
a mining licence is made to the Director in terms of sec 9 of the Act.  Such a hearing
need not necessarily be a formal one, but interested parties should at least be notified
of the application and be given an opportunity to raise their objections in writing.
If necessary, a more formal procedure can then be initiated.  Nothing in sec 9 or in
the rest of the Act either expressly or by necessary implication excludes the
application of the rule, and there are no considerations of public policy militating
against its application.  On the contrary, the application of the rule is indicated by
virtue of the enormous damage mining can do to the environment and ecological
systems.  What has to be ensured when application is made for the issuing of a
mining licence is that development which meets present needs will take place
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (the

criterion proposed in the Brundtland Report : World Commission on Environment
and Development, Our Common Future, Oxford University Press 1987).  Our
Constitution, by including environmental rights as fundamental, justiciable human
rights, by necessary implication requires that environmental considerations be
accorded appropriate recognition and respect  in the administrative processes in our
country.   Together with the change in the ideological climate must also come a
change in our legal and administrative approach to environmental concerns.
In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs, including the costs of two
counsel.

OPSOMMING
Strafproses - toelaatbaarheid van aanwysings
Vraag na toelaatbaarheid van aanwysings deur appellant. In antwoord op ’n vraag deur polisie
offisier wat aanwysings moes waarneem, beweer appellant dat ’n speurder hom aangerand het.
Versuim deur polisie offisier om verdere vrae ter opheldering van beweerde aanranding te vra.
Betroubare getuienis namens staat tydens binneverhoor dat appellant nie aangerand is nie. Geen
getuienis onder eed deur of namens appellant dat hy wel aangerand is nie.
Bevind dat polisie offisier se versuim om verdere vrae met betrekking tot beweerde aanranding te
vra nie voldoende rede opsigselfstaande is om die aanwysings ontoelaatbaar te maak nie.

U I T S P R A A K
F H GROSSKOPF AR:
[1] Die appellant en ’n mede-beskuldigde het voor Buys R in die Kalahari Rondgang Plaaslike
Afdeling tereggestaan op aanklagte van moord, roof en menseroof. Die appellant was
beskuldigde 2 in die hof a quo. Albei is op al drie aanklagte skuldig bevind en tot ’n effektiewe
termyn van 24 jaar gevangenisstraf gevonnis.
[2] Beskuldigde 1 se aansoek om verlof om teen sy skuldigbevinding en vonnis te appelleer is
deur die hof a quo van die hand gewys. In die geval van die appellant is beperkte verlof om te
appelleer toegestaan, soos blyk uit die bevel van die hof a quo wat soos volg lui:
""2. Die beskuldigde nommer 2 se aansoek om op die meriete teen sy skuldigbevinding en vonnis
te appelleer word van die hand gewys.

3. Die beskuldigde nommer 2 se aansoek om teen hierdie Hof se uitspraak in die binneverhoor te
appelleer word toegestaan op die volgende gronde naamlik dat daar ’n redelike moontlikheid is
dat:
(a) die Grondwetlike Hof mag beslis dat:
(i) die beskuldigde nommer 2 se versuim om te getuig of getuienis aan te bied nie teen hom in
aanmerking geneem kon word nie weens die bepalings van artikel 25(1)(c) van die Grondwet;
(ii) die beskuldigde nommer 2 se regte op regsverteenwoordiging nie behoorlik ingevolge artikel
25(1)(c) van die Grondwet aan hom verduidelik is nie.
(b) Die Appèlhof mag beslis dat die aanwysing en gepaardgaande verklaring deur die
beskuldigde nommer 2 nie vrywillig en ongedwonge was nie weens sy verklaring aan
Superintendent Myburgh dat hy aangerand was.
4. Verlof word aan die beskuldigde nommer 2 verleen om eers die gronde waarna in paragraaf
3(b) hierbo verwys word op appèl te neem na die Appèlafdeling van die Hooggeregshof van Suid-
Afrika.""
[3] Dit is duidelik dat daar geen algemene verlof om te appelleer aan die appellant toegestaan is
nie. Soos ek die bevel van die hof a quo begryp, is die omvang van die appèl voor hierdie hof
beperk, eerstens tot die uitspraak van die hof a quo in die binneverhoor, en dan tweedens tot die
enkel vraag of die appellant se aanwysings en gepaardgaande verklarings vrywillig en
ongedwonge was, gesien sy verklaring aan superintendent Myburgh dat hy aangerand was. Daar
is geen verdere appèl op enige ander aspek van die saak voor ons nie.
[4] Die beperkte basis waarop verlof om te appelleer toegestaan is, mag probleme geskep het
indien hierdie hof die toelaatbaarheidsaspek gemeld in paragraaf 3(b) van die bevel in die guns
van die appellant sou beslis het. Dan sou die vraag ontstaan het of die skuldigbevinding kon bly
staan en of die appellant op die oorblywende getuienis aan enige van die misdrywe skuldig was.
[5] Ten einde die bevel in paragraaf 3(b) in konteks te sien, is dit nodig om kortliks na sekere
getuienis in die binneverhoor te verwys. Die appellant, beskuldigde 1 en nog twee ander
verdagtes is omstreeks 11:30 op Woensdag 28 Junie 1995, die oggend nadat die misdade
gepleeg is, deur kaptein Jacobs en inspekteur Van der Westhuizen gearresteer. Die vier
verdagtes het in ’n motor gery wat deur die appellant bestuur is toe die polisie hulle voorgekeer
het. Aangesien die polisie vermoed het dat die verdagtes in besit van vuurwapens kon wees, het
hulle die vier beveel om uit te klim en op die grond te gaan lê. Volgens Van der Westhuizen het
die appellant op ’n stadium probeer opstaan waarop hy die appellant op sy rug getrap het om
hom weer plat op die grond te kry.
[6] Dieselfde Woensdag om ongeveer 15:25 is die appellant na superintendent Myburgh by die
Hartswater speurderskantoor geneem. Myburgh sou die beoogde aanwysings waarneem.
Voordat die aanwysings ’n aanvang geneem het, het Myburgh ’n onderhoud met die appellant
gevoer. Hy het aan die hand van ’n standaard vorm die appellant se regte aan hom verduidelik en
hom onder andere gewaarsku dat hy nie verplig was om enige toneel of punt op die toneel aan te
wys of om enigiets daaromtrent te sê nie. Die appellant het aangedui dat hy die waarskuwing
verstaan. Op die daaropvolgende vraag van Myburgh het hy geantwoord dat hy nog begerig is
om die toneel en punte aan te wys.
[7] Al die vrae wat Myburgh die appellant gevra het, verskyn op die standaard vorm. Een van
daardie vrae was of die appellant deur enige persoon aangerand, gedreig of beïnvloed was om
die aanwysings te doen, waarop die appellant soos volg geantwoord het: ""Ja die speurder het my

getrap toe val ek teen die tafel."" Myburgh het die appellant vervolgens gevra of hy enige
beserings of kneusings van welke aard ook al het, waarop die appellant geantwoord het dat hy
nie weet of daar enige merke is nie. Daarna het Myburgh die appellant versoek om sy oorpak
baadjie en hemp uit te trek, en het Myburgh sy waarneming soos volg genotuleer: ""Effense
rooierige merk agter op rug tussen blaaie."" Die appellant is gevra hoe hy die besering opgedoen
het, waarop hy soos volg geantwoord het: ""Toe die speurder my trap, het ek teen die tafel geval.""
Myburgh het getuig dat hy hom streng by die bewoording van die vorm gehou het en dat hy nie
enige verdere vrae ter opheldering van die beweerde aanranding gevra het nie. Myburgh is
gekritiseer omdat hy versuim het om verdere vrae in dié verband te vra. Dit is ’n aspek waarop ek
later sal terugkom.
[8] Direk na die voorlopige ondervraging van die appellant het Myburgh voortgegaan met die
aanwysings. Volgens die appellant se aanwysings en verduidelikings plaas hy homself op die
toneel in die geselskap van die oorledene en beskuldigde 1 op die betrokke Dinsdagaand toe die
misdade gepleeg is.
[9] Die verdediging het betwis dat die appellant se aanwysings en gepaardgaande verklarings
vrywillig en ongedwonge was. Die bewyslas rus natuurlik op die Staat om aan te toon dat
aanwysings en gepaardgaande verklarings vrywilliglik en ongedwonge deur ’n beskuldigde
gemaak is. (S v Sheehama 1991 (2) SA 860(A) op 878H-880C; S v January; Prokureur-Generaal,
Natal v Khumalo 1994(2) SASV 801 (A) op 806h-807g.) ’n Binneverhoor het gevolg waartydens
verskeie lede van die polisiediens, insluitende superintendent Myburgh en inspekteur Van der
Westhuizen getuig het. Die appellant het nie self in die binneverhoor getuig nie, en terloops ook
nie in die hoof verhoor nie, soos hy natuurlik geregtig was om te doen. Daar is ook geen ander
getuienis namens die appellant tydens die binneverhoor aangebied nie.
[10] Die enigste getuienis onder eed dat daar geweld op die appellant toegepas is, is Van der
Westhuizen se getuienis dat hy tydens die arrestasie op die appellant se rug getrap het. Die
appellant steun egter nie op daardie geweld vir sover dit die toelaatbaarheid van sy aanwysings
betref nie. Volgens die appellant se advokaat verwys die aanranding wat die appellant aan
Myburgh genoem het, (nl dat ’n speurder hom getrap het en dat hy teen ’n tafel geval het) ook
glad nie na Van der Westhuizen se trap nie, en bestaan daar dus geen verband tussen Van der
Westhuizen se trap en die beweerde aanranding nie.
[11] Dit is egter die appellant se saak, soos blyk uit stellings wat sy advokaat tydens
kruisondervraging aan die staatsgetuies gemaak het, dat hy veel erger aangerand was as wat
Myburgh op die vorm aangeteken het. Volgens daardie stellings tydens kruisverhoor sou die
appellant verder aan Myburgh genoem het dat hy deur sekere polisiebeamptes met die vuis en
plat hand geslaan is en dat hy, soos dit gestel is, ge-""choke"" is, wat volgens die appellant se
advokaat beteken dat hy geskok is met ’n elektriese porstok wat gebruik word om beeste mee
aan te por. Dit is verder aan Myburgh gestel dat die appellant aan hom sou gesê het dat hy
voorgesê is wat om aan Myburgh te sê. Myburgh het al hierdie bewerings ontken en geantwoord
dat dit wat op die vorm staan presies is soos wat die appellant dit aan hom meegedeel het.
[12] Dit is tydens die verdediging se kruisondervraging in die binneverhoor aan Van der
Westhuizen gestel dat hy die appellant ten tyde van die arrestasie eers beledig het en toe plat
geskop het. Dit is verder aan hom gestel dat hy en ander polisiebeamptes die appellant daarna
by die speurderskantoor in Hartswater geklap en met die vuis geslaan het, en dat hulle aan die
appellant gesê het dat hy ""sekere punte"" moet gaan uitwys. Hierdie aantygings is almal deur Van
der Westhuizen ontken. Soortgelyke stellings van aanrandings is ook aan die ander polisie
getuies gemaak maar deur hulle ontken.
[13] Die bewering van ’n enkel aanranding wat die appellant voor die aanwysings aan Myburgh
genoem het, was nie tydens kruisondervraging verder toegelig nie. Daar was trouens geen

bewering tydens die kruisondervraging namens die appellant dat ’n speurder hom getrap het en
dat hy toe teen ’n tafel geval het nie.
[14] Die hof a quo het in sy uitspraak in die binneverhoor bevind dat die appellant nie aangerand
was nie en dat die aanwysings vrywillig en ongedwonge was. Daar was direkte en prima facie
aanvaarbare getuienis van die staatsgetuies dat die appellant nie aangerand was nie (soos
tydens kruisondervraging deur hom beweer) en dat die aanwysings vrywillig en ongedwonge
was. Daar was geen getuienis tot die teendeel waarvolgens die korrektheid en geloofwaardigheid
van daardie getuienis beoordeel kon word nie. Die hof a quo het egter nie die staat se getuienis
sonder meer aanvaar nie, maar eers tot ’n beslissing gekom nadat die korrektheid en
betroubaarheid van daardie getuienis oorweeg is in die lig van die bewerings van aanranding
deur die appellant gemaak. Met daardie benadering kan geen fout gevind word nie.
[15] Die vraag is of die hof a quo se beslissing in hierdie verband korrek was of nie. Na my
mening kan dit nie gesê word dat die hof a quo in enige opsig in sy beoordeling van die getuienis
misgetas het nie, en is daar geen rede om die korrektheid van die hof se feitebevindings in twyfel
te trek nie. Gesien Van der Westhuizen se getuienis dat hy tydens arrestasie op die appellant se
rug getrap het, kan die ""effens rooierige merk"" op die appellant se rug ook min, indien enige,
stawing vir die beweerde aanranding bied.
[16] Die betoog is egter dat die appellant se aanwysings om ander oorwegings nie toegelaat
moes gewees het nie. Daar is aangevoer dat Myburgh hoegenaamd nie sonder verdere navrae
met die aanwysings moes voortgegaan het nadat die appellant eenmaal verklaar het dat hy
aangerand was nie. Dit is gemene saak dat Myburgh nie verdere vrae gevra het nie maar dat hy
hom streng by die vrae in die standaard vorm gehou het. Die appellant se betoog is dat Myburgh
sy plig in hierdie opsig versuim het. Hy is verder verwyt omdat hy nagelaat het om die appellant
te vra of hy ondanks die beweerde aanranding nog steeds begerig was om met die beoogde
aanwysings voort te gaan. Die hof a quo het bevind dat daar sonder enige twyfel ’n plig op
superintendent Myburgh gerus het om die hele aangeleentheid verder te ondersoek en dat hy sy
plig in hierdie verband skromelik versuim het. Die appellant se argument was dat Myburgh se
pligsversuim so ernstig van aard was dat dit opsigselfstaande die aanwysings uitgesluit het.
[17] Soos reeds gemeld het die hof a quo bevind dat die staat bewys het dat die appellant nie
aangerand of gedwing was om die aanwysings te doen nie. Die hof a quo het verder daarop
gewys dat die verdediging nie tydens die binneverhoor na die beweerde trap op die appellant se
rug verwys het nie, en dat dit dus suiwer teoretiese bespiegelinge sou wees as daar oorweging
geskenk moes word aan moontlike vrae ter opheldering van ’n beweerde aanranding waarop
appellant self nie langer wou steun nie. Die hof a quo het gevolglik bevind dat die aanwysings nie
as gevolg van hierdie versuim van Myburgh ontoelaatbaar is nie.
[18] In die appellant se hoofde van betoog in hierdie hof word die submissie gemaak dat Myburgh
se nalate om die aangeleentheid volledig en deeglik te ondersoek ""fataal vir die staat se saak is"".
Die appellant steun in hierdie verband op ’n reeks beslissings wat handel met die plig wat daar op
landdroste rus wat ’n bekentenis afneem om seker te maak dat die verklaarder die verklaring
vrywillig en ongedwonge wil maak, en indien daar redelike twyfel bestaan, om verdere vrae te vra
wat nie in die standaard vorm voorkom nie. Vergelyk S v Dhlamini en Andere 1981(3) SA 1105
(W) op 1117B-1118A; S v Kekane and Others 1986(4) SA 466 (W) op 474 D-E en 477 A-C; S v
Malume en Andere 1990(1) SASV 65 (T) op 72 h-i; S v Jika and Others 1991(2) SASV 489 (E) op
500 e-i; S v Colt and Others 1992(2) SASV 120 (E) op 124 c-g; S v Sabisa 1993(2) SASV 525
(Tk A) op 532 f-h.
[19] In geeneen van hierdie sake is dit egter beslis dat ’n landdros se pligsversuim in hierdie
verband fataal vir die staat se saak was nie. Hierdie sake het hoofsaaklik gehandel met die vraag
of die betrokke beskuldigde ingevolge die bepalings van die destyds geldende art 217(1)(b)(ii)
van die Strafproseswet 51 van 1977 met die bewyslas opgesaal moes word om aan te toon dat

hy sy bekentenis nie vrywillig en ongedwonge afgelê het nie. Daar is beslis dat ’n landdros
behoorlik ondersoek moet instel om te bepaal of die bekentenis vrywillig en ongedwonge gemaak
gaan word. Indien hy versuim om dit te doen, kan dit lei tot ’n bevinding dat daar nie aan die
vereistes van art 217(1)(b)(ii) voldoen is nie. Dan het die bewyslas op die staat bly rus. Sedert die
Konstitusionele Hof in S v Zuma and Others 1995(2) SA 642 (CC) op 662 C-D [39] beslis het dat
art 217(1)(b)(ii) onkonstitusioneel en gevolglik ongeldig is, bestaan hierdie besondere probleem
egter nie meer nie.
[20] Daar is deur die jare verskeie aanbevelings van die kant van die regbank gemaak met
betrekking tot vrae wat veral landdroste behoort te vra voordat ’n beskuldigde se bekentenis
geneem word. Hierdie voorgestelde vrae is opgeneem in standaard vorms wat deur landdroste
en polisie offisiere gebruik word vir bekentenisse en aanwysings. So byvoorbeeld het Feetham
AR in Rex v Gumede and Another 1942 AD 398 op 433 gewaarsku teen ""the dropping of a veil
between the previous interrogations by the police and the subsequent appearance of the
interrogated person before the magistrate"", en het die geleerde regter voorgestel dat ""some rule
of procedure should be laid down as to questions to be asked by a magistrate, so that the person
making a statement before a magistrate may be encouraged to disclose what has led up to his
appearance before the magistrate for the purpose of making his statement."" In die lig van
Feetham AR se opmerking in die Gumede saak het De Wet HR die volgende aanbeveling op 400
van dieselfde saak gemaak:
""I would suggest very earnestly for the consideration of the Minister of Justice the desirability of
issuing instructions to all magistrates and justices of the peace that, when an accused is brought
before them for the purpose of making any statement in the nature of a confession, they should in
the first place inquire from him whether he has already made a statement and if so the nature of
such statement and especially the reasons actuating him in wishing to repeat the statement.""
[21] In opvolging van die aanbevelings in die Gumede saak het Ogilvie Thompson, destyds Wnd
AR, in R v Mtabela 1958(1) SA 264 (A) op 269 B-D weereens benadruk dat landdroste die
voorgeskrewe vrae moet vra en die antwoorde neerskryf:
""While I agree with the view expressed by HERBSTEIN, J., in R v Hector, 1954 (2) S.A. 138 (C)
at p.142, that it is not for the magistrate recording a confession, but for the trial Court, to
determine any questions of duress or undue influence which may be raised, it is, I think,
nevertheless desirable to emphasise that magistrates should, before proceeding to record a
confession or statement, be meticulous in making the various preliminary enquiries prescribed by
the departmental instructions and in recording the replies thereto. The safeguards prescribed by
the statute are rendered illusory if the magistrate permits himself to become merely an
amanuensis.""
[22] Soos egter uit die laasgenoemde passasie blyk het die geleerde regter dit duidelik gestel dat
dit die verhoorhof is, en nie die landdros voor wie die bekentenis gemaak is nie, wat moet beslis
of die bekentenis vrywillig en ongedwonge is. Met verwysing na die bogenoemde ""rule of
procedure"" wat Feetham AR in Gumede se saak voorgestel het, wys Ogilvie Thompson Wnd AR
op 268 D-F in die Mtabela saak verder daarop dat nie-nakoming van die departementele
voorskrifte nie noodwendig meebring dat die verklaring ontoelaatbaar is nie:
""Salutary though this rule is, it remains an administrative rule only, the mere non-observance of
which will not necessarily render the statement inadmissible. The question remains one of fact:
has it been established in the particular instance that the statement was voluntary? (R. v.
Kuzwayo, 1949 (3) S.A. 761 (A.D.) at p. 768; R.v. Jacobs, 1954 (2) S.A. 320 (A.D.) at p. 327). In
my view, for the reasons indicated earlier in this judgment, it was duly shown that appellant’s
confession was made voluntarily and without undue influence; and in the circumstances of this
case the magistrate’s failure to make any enquiry regarding any possible prior statement does not
render appellant’s confession inadmissible.""

En dan vervolg die geleerde regter verder soos volg op 268 F-G:
""The contention that the magistrate also failed in other respects to make appropriate enquiries of
appellant before recording what the latter had to say would, on the facts of this particular case,
likewise not suffice to exclude the confession.""
(Kyk verder S v Khoza en Andere 1984(1) SA 57(A) op 59E-60A; S v Magwaza 1985(3) SA 29(A)
op 36G-37E; S v Mbatha en Andere 1987(2) SA 272(A) op 279G-280B.)
[23] In die lig van die feite in die onderhawige saak was Myburgh se versuim om verdere vrae ter
opheldering van die beweerde aanranding te vra myns insiens nie voldoende rede
opsigselfstaande om die aanwysings uit te sluit nie. Myburgh het die beweerde aanranding
aangeteken, maar dit was nie sy plig om te beslis of dit die waarheid was of nie. Dit was die taak
van die verhoorhof om uiteindelik in die lig van al die relevante getuienis te beslis of die
aanwysings vrywillig en ongedwonge geskied het. Soos reeds aangedui het die hof a quo tereg
bevind dat dit wel die geval was.
[24] Na my oordeel het die hof a quo die appellant se aanwysings en gepaardgaande verklarings
ondanks Myburgh se gemelde versuim tereg toegelaat. Die appèl van die appellant wat voor
hierdie hof dien word dus afgewys.

UITSPRAAK
NIENABER AR
Die uitspraak van Streicher AR het ek gelees. Ons verskil, vrees ek, wesenlik van
mekaar oor die tweede van die twee vrae wat in die loop van die appèl ter sprake
gekom het. Die vrae is:
(1) of die ""reg, titel en belang"" waarop beslag gelê en wat in eksekusie verkoop is,
regtens beslaglegbaar was; en

(2) of die beslaglegging en eksekusieverkoping agterna nietig verklaar kan word.
Ad (1) : Of die ""reg, titel en belang"" waarop beslag gelê en wat in eksekusie verkoop
is, regtens beslaglegbaar was.
Nog die eksekusielasbrief, ng die stukke in verband met die geregtelike verkoping het
van die dokumentasie voor die hof deel gevorm. Wat verkoop is, is agtereenvolgens in
die pleitstukke, die voorverhoornotule en in die korrespondensie beskryf as die eiser se
reg, titel en belang ""in die hangende geding"", ""in sy eis"" en ""in die betrokke saak"". (Ek
verwys, na gelang van die geval, na die appellant as die eiser en na die betrokke
respondente as die verweerders.)
Die eiser betoog dat wat in werklikheid tydens die geregtelike verkoping verkoop (en
gevolglik gesedeer) is n spes was, te wete, die spes dat die hof, na afhandeling van die
geding, n bepaalde bedrag aan hom sou toeken; en dat daar regtens, volgens Mears v
Pretoria Estate and Market Co Ltd 1906 TS 661 en die gesag wat daarop gevolg het,
nie op 'n blote spes beslag gelê kan word nie.
Tydens betoog is daar nie na Waikiwi Shipping Co Ltd v Thomas Barlow and Sons
(Natal) Ltd and Another 1978 (1) SA 671 (A) verwys nie. In die uitspraak van Jansen
AR is daar wel dicta wat met die eerste oogopslag die indruk mag skep dat wat in die
geval van n res litigiosa sedeer word, juis n spes is (te 677H; 678A; 678H-679B).
Blykens die uitspraak het n actio in personam in die gemene reg by litis contestatio n
actio litigiosa geword. Voor daardie moment kon n vorderingsreg ten opsigte waarvan
aksie ingestel is, wel sedeer word. Na litis contestatio verander die posisie egter.
Aldus verklaar Jansen AR te 678E-H:
""That after litis contestatio a plaintiff should not be entitled by mere agreement
between himself and a third party to transfer his right to prosecute the action,
appears  to be not only in conformity with the basic principles of our law but
also in conformity  with our present day practice. If the Roman prohibition
against alienation of actiones  litigiosae still obtains - cadit quaestio. If the
relaxation of the prohibition, which  clearly occurred in Holland in respect of res
litigiosae, is also related, by way of  analogy, to the alienation of actiones, it
follows that such purported alienation cannot  be complete - it is only effective
salvo jure the defendant. In practice any purported  transfer after litis contestatio

could only become effective if the Court allowed the  cessionary to be
substituted as the plaintiff. This is a matter apparently within the  discretion of
the Court and the Court will refuse the substitution if there is any  prejudice to
the other side (Friedman v Woolfson, supra at p. 525H). The transfer  is,
therefore, only perfected when the Court gives its seal of approval by granting
the  substitution.""
Waikiwi was nie begaan oor beslaglegging en geregtelike verkopings nie. Daar was
die vraag of die verweerder (die eiser in rekonvensie) wat sy ""right, title and interest to
the claim"" teen die eiser (die verweerder in rekonvensie) na litis contestatio aan n
derde sedeer het, daarmee sy locus standi verbeur het om die saak voort te sit. Die
verhoorhof oordeel van ja; hierdie hof van neeDie beginsel wat na my mening uit die
Waikiwi-beslissing te abstraheer is, is dit: waar n vorderingsreg wat die onderwerp
van n geding is na litis contestatio sedeer word, moet die sessionaris, as hy die geding
in eie naam wil voortsit, by die hof aansoek doen om as eiser gesubstitueer te word;
alvorens hy dit doen, beskik hy nie oor die nodige locus standi nie; die keersy is dat
die sedent, tot tyd en wyl sodanige substitusie plaasvind, nie sy locus standi verbeur
nie. Dit is n suiwer prosesregtelike aangeleentheid waarvoor daar gesonde praktiese
redes bestaan.
Afhangende van wat die partye afspreek, gaan die vorderingsreg waaroor daar
gelitigeer word by die sessie daarvan, op een aspek na, op die sessionaris oor. Daardie
aspek is die sessionaris se bevoegdheid om die aksie in eie naam voort te sit. Dit staan
die partye natuurlik vry om onderling ooreen te kom dat die sedent, wat sy locus
standi behou (vgl Portion 1 of 46 Wadeville (Pty) Ltd v Unity Cutlery (Pty) Ltd and
Others 1984 (1) SA 61 (A)), die aksie in eie naam sal voortsit en aan die sessionaris
van die opbrengs daarvan rekenskap doen. Andersins is substitusie nodig.
In die loop van die uitspraak word na Government of the Republic of South Africa v
Ngubane 1972 (2) SA 601 (A) verwys. Daar het dit gegaan oor n reg op
genoegdoening wat nie voor nie maar wel na litis contestatio sedeerbaar was. Om
hierdie eienaardigheid te verklaar, het Holmes AR in Ngubane se saak n onderskeid
getref tussen die ""interest in the claim"" en die ""interest in the result of the litigation"".
In Waikiwi het Jansen AR hierdie onderskeid te 677H na drie gevalle verfyn, te wete,

""(i) the original founding right, (ii) the right arising from litis contestatio to proceed
with the action to its conclusion, (iii) the spes in respect of the benefits that will flow
from the successful conclusion of the proceedings.""
Op 678H tot 679A word dan gesê:
""To the extent that the dictum in Ngubane's case assumes that a right to
prosecute  a claim is not freely cedable, it, with respect, appears to be correct. It
is, therefore,  understandable that it could be said that a cession after litis
contestatio should be  construed as a cession of the spes, thus giving some
immediate legal effect to the  agreement. This, however, can only be the general
rule. The agreement may in terms  envisage a transfer of the right to prosecute
the action, but in such a case it will only  in law divest the plaintiff of his right if
and when the Court grants substitution of the  plaintiff.""
Die klem val op die woord ""freely"". Wat nodig is, indien die sessionaris die aksie wil
voortsit, is n addisionele stap, te wete, sy substitusie as eiser. Die verwysing na n spes
is n verwysing na die situasie waarmee Ngubane se saak te doene gehad het.
Of die onderskeid wat tussen die drie genoemde gevalle in Waikiwi getref word,
dogmaties suiwer is, is debateerbaar (vgl Lubbe, (1980) 43 THRHR 117 126-129). Dit
bly n vraag of dit regtens doenlik is om die bevoegdheid ""to prosecute the action"" van
die vorderingsreg self af te skilfer (vgl First National Bank of SA Ltd v Lynn NO and
Others 1996 (2) SA 339 (A) te 352C-D; 2 Lawsa (first re-issue) par 229 voetnoot 14;
par 241 voetnoot 3; par 272 voetnoot 14); en of die dictum in Waikiwi tred hou met
die regsreël dat n vorderingsreg nie by wyse van sessie en sonder die instemming van
die skuldenaar versplinter kan word nie (2 Lawsa a.w. par 259). Dit daar gelaat.
Ek is dit met my kollega eens dat Waikiwi nie meebring dat die vorderingsreg in die
onderhawige geval nie regsgeldig deur middel van die geregtelike verkoping op die
eerste verweerder oorgedra is nie; voorts, dat wat die eerste verweerder aldus
ingekoop het, nie bloot n spes was nieGevolglik is dit nie nodig om op die verdere
vraag in te gaan of die beredenering in die Mears saak, supra, op die feite van die
huidige geval van toepassing is nie
Ad (2) : Of die beslaglegging en eksekusieverkoping agterna nietig verklaar kan
wordDit wil voorkom of daar twee gronde is aan die hand waarvan gesê word dat die

betrokke beslaglegging en die eksekusieverkoping agterna nietig verklaar kan wordDie
eerste is dat sodanige optrede op n misbruik van die sogenaamde regsproses neerkom.
Die tweede is dat die eerste en vyfde verweerders se optrede met die openbare belang
strydig isIndien eersgenoemde n goeie grond vir die aanvegting van die beslaglegging
en die eksekusieverkoping is, is laasgenoemde grond onnodig. Kom die
regshandelinge waarteen beswaar gemaak word daarenteen nie op n misbruik van die
regsproses neer nie, is dit moeilik in te sien hoe hulle origens met die openbare belang
strydig kan wees. Ewewel, die tweede grond kom net te pas as die eerste grond
misluk. 20
Wat die begrip ""misbruik van die regsproses"" presies behels, is nie allesins duidelik
nie. Die gesag waarop daar in die uitspraak van my kollega gesteun word, het te make
met n moontlike misbruik van die hofproses (""abuse of the process of the court"") en
nie met n misbruik van die regsproses (""abuse of the legal process"") nie. Word dit in
die breedste sin verstaan, het mens denkbaar met die leerstuk van ""misbruik van reg""
te doen, iets waarna die advokaat vir die eiser in sy betoog verwys het, maar wat nie in
my ampsbroer se uitspraak genoem word nie.
Van daardie leerstuk kan daar in die onderhawige geval in elk geval nie sprake wees
nie aangesien die verweerders opgetree het, nie met die uitsluitlike oogmerk om die
eiser te na te kom nie, maar om die belange van die vyfde verweerder te bevorder (vgl
Neethling et al Deliktereg, 3de uitg, 112-113).
""Misbruik van die regsproses"", wat dit ookal presies mag beteken, moet onderskei
word van ""misbruik van die hofproses oftewel hofprosedure"". In laasgenoemde sin is
dit gepleit. n Hof, so is meermale al geleer, beskik oor die inherente bevoegdheid om
enige misbruik van sy verrigtinge hok te slaan. Dit is n bevoegdheid wat aan die
gemene reg ontleen en gedeeltelik ook statutêr gereël word. (Sien oor die algemeen
Herbstein & Van Winsen, The Civil Practice of the Supreme Court of South Africa,
4de uitg, 546-7; 1110 - 1113; die Wet op Kwelsugtige Gedinge 3 van 1956; en artikel
173 van die Grondwet 108 van 1996.)
Ek bepaal my hoofsaaklik by die gesag waarna my kollega in sy uitspraak verwys. Die
buitelandse gewysdes het deur die bank met n beweerde misbruik van die hofproses in
die loop van die litigasieproses te doen.

Wat die Engelse reg betref, bepaal Order 18 soos volg:
""1) The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or
amended any pleading or the indorsement of any writ in the action, or anything
in any  pleading or in the indorsement, on the ground that -
(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case
may be; or
(b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or
(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action;
or
(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court;and may
order the action to be    stayed or dismissed or judgment to be
entered accordingly, as the case may be.""
Die woorde ""an abuse of the process of the Court"", so is gesê,""connotes that the
process of the Court must be used bona fide and   properly and must not be abused.
The court will prevent the improper use  of its machinery, and will, in a proper case,
summarily prevent its  machinery from being used as a means of vexation and
oppression in the process of litigation"" (The Supreme Court Practice (1995) 344).
In re Majory [1955] 1 Ch 600 623 het te doene gehad met die vraag of die skuldeiser
""extortion"" (soos dit in daardie saak verstaan is) beoog het. In Goldsmith v Sperrings
Limited [1977] 2 All ER 566 (CA) verduidelik Lord Denning die beginsel soos volg te
574:
""In a civilised society, legal process is the machinery for keeping order and
doing justice. It can be used properly or it can be abused. It is used properly
when it is  invoked for the vindication of men's rights or the enforcement of just
claims. It is  abused when it is diverted from its true course so as to serve
extortion or oppression; or  to exert pressure so as to achieve an improper end.
When it is so abused, it is a tort, a  wrong known to the law. The judges can and
will intervene to stop it. They will stay the  legal process, if they can, before any
harm is done. If they cannot stop it in time, and  harm is done, they will give
damages against the wrongdoer ...

At other times the abuse can only be shown by extrinsic evidence that the legal
process  is being used for an improper purpose. On the face of it, in any particular
case, the  legal process may appear to be entirely proper and correct. What may make
it wrongful is  the purpose for which it is used. If it is done in order to exert pressure
so as to  achieve an end which is improper in itself, then it is a wrong known to the
law. This  appears distinctly from the case which founded this tort.""
Die klem val telkens op die onbehoorlikheid van  of die optrede  of die oogmerk. In
die Engelse reg, blykens die dictum, kan die misbruik van so n aard wees dat dit op n
""tort"" neerkom. By ons kan dergelike optrede in gepaste gevalle onder die algemene
rubriek van ""kwelsugtige gedingvoering"" tuisgebring word (vgl, oor die algemeen, 15
Lawsa par 595 en volgende). Dit verg bewys van die afwesigheid van ""reasonable and
probable cause"".
Die begrip ""misbruik"" veronderstel onbehoorlikheid (waarby ongeoorloofdheid
inbegrepe is). Die onbehoorlikheid in die geval van misbruik van die hofproses kan
geleë wees, in Engeland sowel as hier,  of in die aard van die optrede van die betrokke
litigant  F3f in die resultaat wat hy nastreef, of albei.
Voorbeelde van eersgenoemde soort geval, waar die metodes wat hy aanwend
onbehoorlik is, is onder meer Hudson v Hudson & Another 1927 AD 259 en Janit &
Another v Motor Industry Fund Administrators (Pty) Ltd & Another 1995 (4) SA 293
(A).
In Hudson het die eiser, wie se eksepsie teen die eerste verweerder se verweerskrif
voorheen misluk het, twee dae voor die verhoor n aanvang moes neem wesenlik
dieselfde eksepsie teen die tweede verweerder se verweerskrif geopper, tesame met n
aansoek om uitstel van die verhoor.
Die tweede verweerder antwoord daarop met n aansoek om die deurhaling van die
eksepsie. Die aansoek slaag, die uitstel word geweier en dit lei tot die afwysing van
die eis. Op sy beurt misluk die eiser se app èl teen gemelde bevele. Die optrede van
die eiser, om n eksepsie te opper wat vantevore reeds misluk het en aldus geen meriete
gehad het nie, was n blote taktiese set om n uitstel te bekom waarop hy andersins nie
geregtig was nie; en was as sodanig klaarblyklik onbehoorlik. Dit is in daardie verband
wat die dictum van De Villiers AR te 268 verstaan moet word:

""When therefore the Court finds an attempt made to use for ulterior purposes
machinery devised for the better administration of justice, it is the duty of the
Court to  prevent such abuse. But it is a power which has to be exercised with
great caution, and  only in a clear case. In the present instance I have no doubt
that the exception was taken  solely for the purpose of forcing the postponement
which had been refused by WATERMEYER,  J. on the same day.""
In Janit het dit onder meer gegaan om n interdik om die respondent te verbied om van
n gesteelde bandopname wat vertroulike en geprivilegeerde en andersins irrelevante
besonderhede bevat het, gebruik te maak. Die respondent het die bandopname
blootgelê. Hy het dit van die dief ontvang wat n grief teen die appellant gekoester het.
Die respondent was van voorneme om in die hangende geding tussen die partye
daarvan gebruik te maak wat vir die appellant in die pers n verleentheid kon skep. Dit
is n klinkklare geval waar die optrede van die party as sodanig onbehoorlik was; die
taktiek is gefnuik.
Gevalle van misbruik wat n onbehoorlike oogmerk behels, is legio. So byvoorbeeld sê
Lord Watson te 732-3 van King v Henderson [1898] AC 720, n beslissing waarna
sydelings in my kollega se uitspraak verwys word:
""In In re Davies the Court of Appeal refused to make an adjudication in
bankruptcy, where it was clearly shewn that the proceedings had been used and
was meant to  be used for the illegitimate and fraudulent purpose of extorting
money from the debtor.  And, again, in Ex parte Griffin, the same Court,
although there was a good petitioning  creditor's debt, and an act of bankruptcy
had been committed, refused to make an  adjudication. The ratio of the decision
was thus explained by James L.J.: 'I think I never  knew a case so transparent as
to the fraud with which the whole thing was conceived, and  the oppression
which it was intended to exercise. It would, I think, be a shocking thing  for any
court of justice in a civilised country to be made the instrument of proceedings
like these'.""
Die soort geval kom ook voor waar n litigant in die loop van die gedingvoering stappe
doen wat opsigself geen meriete het nie en bloot bedoel is om sy opponent te treiter. n
Tipiese voorbeeld hiervan is Beinash v Wixley 1997 (3) SA 721 (A). Daar het dit

gegaan oor die tersydestelling van n dagvaarding duces tecum. Op grond van die wye
en onpresiese strekking en die tydsberekening daarvan, word bevind dat dieuitreiking
van die dagvaarding met n onbehoorlike oogmerk geskied het - om te teister - en as
sodanig tersyde gestel moes word. Aldus word deur Mahomed HR te 736I-737C gesê:
""Significantly, the appellant declined all of these opportunities. The inference
which I am forced to draw is that the appellant's objective in invoking the
machinery of  Rule 38(1) did not constitute a bona fide attempt to secure
documentary evidence which he  thought he needed for the preparation of his
case. The impugned subpoena appears to me to  be intended as a missile to
oppress and harass the respondentMr Zar contended that the  discovery
provisions of Rule 35 and the subpoena provisions of Rule 38 constitute
independent and separate instruments, both of which a litigant is entitled to
employ in  the preparation of a case. I have no doubt that this is indeed so. The
objective of Rule  35 is to enable a litigant to discover documents in the
possession or control of another  party to the proceedings, whereas the primary
objective of Rule 38 is to secure the  production of documents from persons who
are not necessarily parties in the main  proceedings, such as Wixley. The
distinction is perfectly sound, but the machinery  contained in both of these
Rules must be utilised in a bona fide manner and not for the  purposes of
pursuing ends extraneous to the real objectives sought to be attained through
these Rules. The existence of bona fides is the basic precondition upon which
both of  these Rules are premised.""
Die blote aanwending van n bepaalde hofprosedure vir n doel anders as waarvoor dit
primêr bestem is, is tiperend, maar nog nie voldonge bewys, van mala fides nie;
daarvoor is die verdere afleiding nodig dat die resultaat wat beoog is, soos in Wixley,
onbehoorlik was. n Sodanige aanwending (vir n doel anders as waarvoor dit primêr
bestem is) is dus n kenmerk, eerder as die definisie, van mala fides.
n Voorbeeld van die werking van die beginsel is te vinde in sekwestrasieverrigtinge.
Die primêre oogmerk van sekwestrasie is om n concursus creditorum te bewerkstellig.
In Estate Logie v Priest 1926 AD 312 is pertinent beslis dat dit, anders as in die
Engelse reg, nie onbehoorlik is indien die sekwestrasieprosedure aangewend word nie

om n concursus creditorum teweeg te bring nie maar om die skuldenaar aan te spoor
om sy skuld te delg. Dieselfde gedagtegang is ook aan te tref in Kalil v Decotex (Pty)
Ltd and Another1988 (1) SA 943 (A) te 955 waar Corbett AR verklaar:
""The English authorities so relied upon seem to be distinguishable as they
emphasise that it is a scandalous abuse of process of the Court to seek to use a
winding-up procedure to seek to enforce payment by the company of a disputed
debt as a  means to exercise pressure to seek to exact payment. To seek to
enforce payment by way of  such proceedings is legitimate in South Africa.
Estate Logie v Priest 1926 AD 312  at 319, 320; Laeveldse Kooperasie Beperk v
Joubert 1980 (3) SA 1117 (T) at  1121H-1122F. ... The fact that the application
is intended to enforce payment is  irrelevant to the appellant bringing his
application as a member of the first respondent;  and is, in any event, not a good
ground in law, as such intention is legitimate in such  proceedings.""
Weer eens val die klem, ondanks die aanwending van die prosedure vir n sekondêre
doel, op die regmatigheid en dus die behoorlikheid van die uiteindelike oogmerk.
Daarbenewens ondervang di E9 dictum heelwat van die Engelse gesag waarop my
kollega hom verlaatIn die onderhawige geval gaan dit nie om n beweerde misbruik in
of tydens die litigasie as sodanig nie. Die ""regsproses"" waarvan daar in my ampsbroer
se uitspraak gewag gemaak word, is die volgende: (i) n Vonnisskuld van die eiser. (ii)
Versuim deur die eiser as vonnisskuldenaar om die vonnisskuld te delg. (iii) n
Beslaglegging deur die vonnisskuldeisers (die tweede en derde verweerders) van die
eiser se vorderingsreg teen die vyfde verweerder. (iv) Volgehoue wanbetaling van die
vonnisskuld deur die eiser. (v) n Eksekusieverkoping ooreenkomstig die voorskrifte
van die reg ingevolge waarvan die vorderingsreg deur die balju aan n bondgenoot van
die vyfde verweerder, die eerste verweerder, verkoop word.
Tot sover skeel daar niks aan enige van die stappe wat deur die verweerders geneem is
en kan daar van onbehoorlikheid aan hul kant ook geen sprake wees nie. As iemand te
blameer is, was dit die eiser self. Dit was hy wat die verkeerde partye voor die hof
gesleep en n kosterekening van oor die R50 000 opgeloop het wat hy op sy beurt nie
vereffen het nie. Sy vorderingsreg teen die vyfde verweerder was n bate in sy boedel.
Dit was n bate waarop hy self, in sy besonderhede van vordering in die aksie, n

waarde van oor die miljoen rand geplaas het. As dit enigsins n realistiese beskouing
was, was die beslaglegging daarvan terdeë voorsienbaar.
Volgens die eiser setel die onbehoorlikheid wat die geldigheid van die
uitwinningsproses in gedrang bring daarenteen in die oogmerk van die verweerders om
die eis in te koop met die uitsluitlike oogmerk om n einde aan die hangende geding te
maak. Die doel ontheilig as 't ware die middel. Was dit die eiser self of een van sy
bondgenote wat die eis ingekoop het, sou die transaksie stellig in orde wees. So ook as
n derde die eis ingekoop het, al was hy nie van voorneme om die aksie voort te sit nie.
Oogmerk of motief, selfs n moedswillige of kwaadwillige motief, is oor die algemeen
nie n onregmatigheids- of ongeldigheidskriterium nie (vgl Bress Designs (Pty) Ltd v
G.Y. Lounge Suite Manufacturers (Pty) Ltd and Another 1991 (2) SA 455 (W)
475C-476A). Vandaar die dictum in Tsose v Minister of Justice 1951 (3) SA 10 (A) te
17G-H:
""For just as the best motive will not cure an otherwise illegal arrest  so  the worst
motive will not render an otherwise legal arrest illegal"",
waarop die hof a quo hom beroep het. Aldus sou die oorname deur n verweerder van
al sy eiser-maatskappy se aandele nie aanvegbaar wees nie, al was dit uitsluitlik
gedoen met die oog daarop om beheer oor die maatskappy te verkry en sodoende n
einde aan die hangende geding te maak; so ook indien n verweerder om dieselfde
oorweging n klag lê wat tot sy eiser se deportasie en die gevolglike abandonering van
die litigasie lei. Mens kan jou talle dergelike gevalle voorstel.
n Onbehoorlike motief kan, soos reeds gesê, egter wel n faktor wees waar misbruik
van die hofproses ter sprake is. Die formele beëindiging van n geding is deel van die
hofproses. Die uitbuiting, op n onbehoorlike wyse of vir n onbehoorlike doelwit, van n
bepaalde hofreël wat op die beëindiging van die geding betrekking het, sou dus binne
die verskynsel van misbruik van die hofproses val (vgl Castanho v Brown & Root
(UK) Ltd [1981] AC 577; en die Australiese sake waarna in my kollega se uitspraak
verwys is, t.w. Packer v Meagher [1984] 3 NSWLR 486 en TJM Products (Pty) Ltd v
A & P Tyres (Pty) Ltd [1988] 78 ALR 579 (FC)).
Die huidige geval is iets heel anders. Die voortsetting van die hofgeding is in gedrang
nie as gevolg van die interne (ofskoon onbehoorlike) aanwending van n hofreël wat op

so n beëindiging betrekking het, deur die ander litigant, die vyfde verweerder, nie. Die
voortsetting van die geding word hier bedreig deur n eksterne faktor wat los staan van
die hofreëls of hofprosedure. Sou die vyfde verweerder self die eiser se vorderingsreg
ingekoop het, was die eksterne faktor die werking van confusio (vgl Grootchwaing
Salt Works Ltd v Van Tonder 1920 AD 492 497). Dit is egter nie die vyfde verweerder
wat die vorderingsreg ingekoop het nie, maar sy bondgenoot, die eerste verweerder.
Op sigself bring die inkoop van n vorderingsreg deur n buitestander nie n einde aan
die geding nie. Dit sou eers die geval wees indien, soos in ons geval, die eerste
verweerder as nuwe reghebbende opdrag gee om die aksie te staak en daar aan
sodanige opdrag uitvoering gegee word. Dat hy n bondgenoot van die vyfde
verweerder is en die vyfde verweerder se belange op die hart dra, kom nie daarop aan
nie. As die werking van confusio in die hande van die vyfde verweerder self nie
onbehoorlik sou wees nie - wat eintlik die vraag is - kan die eerste verweerder se
samewerking met die vyfde verweerder om n einde aan die aksie te maak, ook nie
onbehoorlik wees nie. Van n onbehoorlike komplot kan daar, in die afwesigheid van n
onbehoorlike motief aan vyfde verweerder se kant, dus nie sprake wees nie.
Die beoogde beëindiging van die geding het met misbruik van die hofproses as
sodanig dus eintlik niks te make nie. Maar daar is gesag wat daarop dui dat die
uitwinningsproses as deel van die hofproses beskou word (vgl Graham v Graham
1950 (1) SA 655 (T) 658; Strime v Strime 1983 (4) SA 850 (C) 852A), al geskied dit
ook na afloop en na afhandeling van die litigasie; en vir doeleindes hiervan sal ek die
benadering in die guns van die eiser as korrek aanvaar. In daardie opsig kan die vyfde
verweerder se motief dus wel relevant wees.
Net soos in die geval van ""misbruik van die hofproses"" in egte sin, moet die misbruik
hier ook n element van onbehoorlikheid inhou, hetsy in die optrede self, hetsy in die
resultaat wat beoog word. Die enkele feit dat die ""regsproses"" anders as vir sy primêr
bestemde doel aangewend word, is, volgens die uitspraak van my kollega, op sigself
darem nie fataal nie, want so iets sou tog deug mits dit redelik was om dit te doen. Die
keersy daarvan is dat dit wel tersyde gestel sou kon word indien die aanwending van
die regsproses onredelik sou wees. As onder ""regsproses"" ""hofproses"" verstaan word,
en ""onredelikheid"" as ""onbehoorlikheid"" vertolk word, pas dit in by die bespreking van

die gesag hierbo.
Die onredelikheid, oftewel onbehoorlikheid, setel volgens die eiser in die uitgespoke
oogmerk van die eerste en vyfde verweerders om n einde aan die geding te maak. Dit
gaan om hul, veral die vyfde verweerder, se motief. Maar indien hul motief die
deurslaggewende faktor is, moet dit nie selektief beoordeel word nie, maar in sy volle
omvang. Die motief van die eerste en vyfde verweerder blyk uit n skrywe van hul
prokureur aan die balju, gedateer 3 November 1992 wat op 413C-D van die
gerapporteerde uitspraak, Brummer v Gorfil Brothers Investments (Pty) Ltd en Andere
1997 (2) SA 411 (T), voorkom:
""U sal merk dat dit die saaknommer is waaronder hierdie lasbrief uitgereik is.
Mnr. Brummer het n aksie teen ons kliënt gebring en ons kliënt glo dat die aksie
kwelsugtig is. Ons kliënt wil op die reg, titel en belang beslag lê en dit dan per
veiling inkoop om sodoende die aksie tot niet te maak.""
n Verweerder wat van n statutêre prosedure gebruikmaak, naamlik die beslaglegging
en inkoop op die ope mark van n vorderingsreg, ten einde op die wyse n aksie teen
hom tot niet te kan maak wat hy as kwelsugtig beskou, het myns insiens nie n
afkeurenswaardige of onbehoorlike oogmerk nie. Die vraag of sy siening van die saak
as kwelsugtig objektief gesproke geregverdig was, is nie ter sake nie, want dit gaan, op
die eiser se benadering, bloot om die vyfde verweerder se motief. Maar selfs al sou die
kriterium ""bybedoeling plus onredelikheid"" wees, soos in my kollega se uitspraak
gesuggereer word, kan die vyfde verweerder op die ooreengekome feite na my mening
nie verkwalik word nie Dit is geen antwoord om te beweer, soos in my kollega se
uitspraak gedoen word, dat daar ander middele is om kwelsugtige optrede af te weer
nie. Die vraag is nie of die eiser se optrede werklik kwelsugtig was en aan die
vereistes van Wet 3 van 1956 voldoen nie, maar, vanuit die vyfde   verweerder se
oogpunt, of hy geglo het dat die aksie kwelsugtig was. As hy dit werklik geglo het,
was sy motief nie onbehoorlik of selfs onredelik nie. Op die feite wat hier gemeensaak
was, kan die teendeel nie betoog word nie.
Na my mening was die besluit van die twee verweerders om op die vorderingsreg
beslag te lê en dit by die geregtelike verkoping in te  koop (ten einde op di E9 manier
van n aksie ontslae te raak wat met  behulp van regshulp teen die vyfde verweerder

gevoer word sodat hy op stuk van sake op eie koste litigeer), nie onbehoorlik nie, nie
onredelik nie, en nie deur n afkeurenswaardige motief aangevuur nie.
In Madden v B.P. Southern Africa (Pty) Ltd 1967 (2) SA 326 (D) is te 328A-B gesê:
""It does not follow, of course, that the judgment creditor will acquire this right
at the sale in execution but, even if he does and decides to utilise his right in a
way  which would frustrate the applicant's right of appeal, that is merely one of
the incidents  of the sale in execution; it is part of the price which the judgment
debtor, who cannot  pay his creditor in any other way, has to pay in order to put
the judgment creditor in  possession of funds which will go towards satisfying
his claim.""
Die dictum is met goedkeuring aangehaal in latere sake soos Marais v Aldridge and
Others 1976 (1) SA 746 (T) te 750B-C en Soja (Pty) Ltd v Tuckers Land Development
Corporation (Pty) Ltd and Another 1981 (2) SA 407 (W) te 410B-C. Met daardie
siening gaan ek akkoord. 20
Sowel die eiser as my kollega steun swaar op Whitfield v Van Aarde 1993 (1) SA 332
(E) en sekere beslissings wat dit voorafgegaan het. Dit is almal sake wat te doene
gehad het met n aansoek om n voorgenome eksekusieverkoping tydelik op te skort.
Die hof, so is daar beslis, beskik oor n diskresie om dit te beveel. Indien die
benadering van die eiser en van my kollega reg is, is al hierdie sake natuurlik verkeerd
beslis, want dan was die beslaglegging en die daaropvolgende verkoping uit wans uit
nietig en het die kwessie van n diskresie glad nie ter sprake gekom nie. Maar op die
veronderstelling dat so n diskresie wel bestaan, sal n hof vanselfsprekend alle
relevante faktore in ag neem. Een daarvan kan stellig wees dat die beslaglegging en
die eksekusieverkoping besmoontlik tot die beëindiging van n aksie kan lei wat op die
oog af meriete het en wat op die punt staan om beslis te word. Dit is iets heel anders
as om te konkludeer dat n beslaglegging en die daaropvolgende eksekusieverkoping
wat behoorlik en reëlmatig geskied het, op n misbruik van die regsproses neerkom wat
as sodanig deur n hof tersyde gestel kan word omdat die voortsetting van die aksie
daardeur bedreig word. (Vgl, vir die erkende gronde vir die tersydestelling van so n
geregtelike verkoping, Le Roux v Yskor Landgoed (Edms) en Andere 1984 (4) SA 252
(T).)

Die tweede grond wat vir die nietigheid van die beslaglegging en die
eksekusieverkoping aangevoer word, is dat di E9 regshandelinge met die openbare
belang in stryd sou wees. Di E9 grondslag sou alleen ter sprake kom indien n misbruik
van die hofprosedure (of die regsproses) nie bevind kan word nie. En as dit nie bevind
kan word nie, kan dit ook nie n faktor wees by die oorweging van wat nou eintlik met
die openbare belang in stryd sou wees nie.
Die uitreiking van n lasbrief, die beslaglegging en die eksekusieverkoping is
opeenvolgende regstappe, statutêr gereël, ten einde die delging van n vonnisskuld te
bewerkstellig (Herbstein & Van Winsen a.w. 754). In die onderhawige geval het al di
E9 stappe reëlmatig en sonder teenkanting van die appellant geskied. Die bedrag wat
by wyse van geregtelike verkoping deur die eerste verweerder vir die inkoop van die
eis betaal is, is in die afhandeling van die proses aangewend.
n Eksekusieverkoping is in wese n ooreenkoms wat, soos enige ander ooreenkoms,
ongeoorloof en as sodanig nietig sou wees indien, algemeen gesproke, die sluiting
daarvan, die prestasie wat daarvolgens gelewer moet word, die strekking daarvan of
die oogmerk van albei die kontrakterende partye met  F3f die reg,  F3f die goeie sedes
F3f die openbare belang (en dus die openbare beleid) in stryd sou wees (vgl Van der
Merwe et al Contract General Principles, 139). n Onbehoorlike oogmerk sou die
ooreenkoms slegs aanvegbaar maak indien dit die bedoeling van albei die
kontrakterende partye was. Daarvan is daar hier geen sprake nie. Die onbehoorlike
oogmerk wat een van die kontrakterende partye mag koester, is irrelevant (Van der
Merwe et al a.w. 143).
Wat dan oorbly, indien die misbruik van die sogenaamde regsproses buite rekening
gelaat word, is, blykens die uitspraak van my kollega, onredelikheid, onbillikheid,
""simple justice between man and man"" en die afleiding wat skynbaar gemaak word dat
die eiser "" n minvermoënde, ongesofistikeerde persoon"" is wat uitgebuit kan word
deur n ""vermoënde persoon"" wat die eis hand en tand beveg. Dat die appellant met
regshulp ageer, is n faktor wat na my mening buite rekening gelaat moet word. n
Litigant wat regshulp ontvang is, afgesien daarvan dat sy eis deur die staat
gesubsidieer word, nie vis- E0-vis sy teenparty regtens in n sterker posisie as
enigiemand anders nieKom dit by die eiser se beroep op billikheid en die openbare

belang, is ek bevrees dat my kollega en ek op die feite van hierdie geval eenvoudig net
van mekaar verskil. Hy is geneë om die beroep te handhaaf. Ek nie.
Openbare beleid, gegrond op die openbare belang, is g'n juridiese doepa nie. Die juiste
benadering daartoe word gekenskets deur drie onlangse dicta. Die eerste het te doen
met billikheid, die ander twee met die openbare beleid.In Fisheries Development
Corporation of SA Ltd v Jorgensen and Another 1979 (3) SA 1331 (W) te 1340B-D
verklaar Nicholas R:
""The Courts do not however act on abstract ideas of justice and equity. They
must  act on principle. Cf the Western Assurance Co case supra at 275. And see
the remarks of  INNES CJ in Kent v Transvaalsche Bank 1907 TS 765 at
773-774:
""(The appellant) also asked us to stay the proceedings on equitable
grounds,    urging that we had an equitable jurisdiction under the
insolvency law. The Court has again    and again had occasion to
point out that it does not administer a system of equity, as    distinct
from a system of law. Using the word 'equity' in its broad sense, we
are always    desirous to administer equity; but we can only do so in
accordance with the principles of    the Roman-Dutch law. If we
cannot do so in accordance with those principles, we cannot do    so
at all.""
Die tweede dictum kom ook van Nicholas Wnd AR in Longman Distillers Ltd v Drop
Inn Group of Liquor Supermarkets (Pty) Ltd 1990 (2) SA 906 (A) te 913G-914C, wat
op die feite n veel sterker saak as die eiser s'n is vir n beroep op die openbare beleid:
""Public policy is an imprecise and elusive concept. It is said to reflect the  mores
and fundamental assumptions of the community (Cheshire, Fifoot and
Furmston's Law of  Contract 11th ed at 345). Wessels Law of Contract in South
Africa vol 1 s 488, says'An act  which is contrary to the interests of the
community is said to be an act contrary to  public policy.'
Public policy is the general sense of justice of the community, the boni mores,
manifested in public opinion ... When a court is asked to hold that something is

against  public policy, it does well to remind itself of the much-quoted passage in
the judgment of  Burrough J in Richardson v Mellish (1824) 2 Bing 229 at 252
(130 ER 294 at 303):
'I, for one, protest ... against arguing too strongly upon public
policy; - it is a    very unruly horse, and when once you get astride it
you never know where it will carry    you. It may lead you from the
sound law. It is never argued at all but when other points    fail.I
cannot see how public policy can be at all involved in a question
whether a    particular incorporeal right should be attached ad
fundandam, or whether a particular    incola should be permitted to
sue a particular peregrinus in the Cape Provincial Division.    Only
the interests of Longman and Drop Inn are involved, not the
interests or general    sense of justice of the community. The
question does not raise any important moral issue,    or any principle
affecting the fundamental assumptions of the community. It seems
to me    that au fond Longman's objection is that the attachment was
'unfair'; and that its    representatives have attempted to elevate this
into a matter of public policy.""
Die derde dictum word deur my ampsbroer self aangehaal. Dit is die  vermanende
woorde van Smalberger AR in Sasfin (Pty) Ltd v Beukes 1989 (1) SA 1 (A) te 9B:
""One must be careful not to conclude that a contract is contrary to public policy
merely because its terms (or some of them) offend one's individual sense of
propriety and  fairness.""
Die appèl word van die hand gewys met koste.

P M NIENABER
APPèLREGTER
STEM SAAM:
Van Heerden AHR

Harms AR
STREICHER AR:
Die wesenlike vraag wat in hierdie appèl beslis moet word, is of eksekusieverkoping
wat gehou word om skuldenaar se reg, titel en belang in aksie te bekom ten einde die
litigasie te beëindig en nie om die onderliggende vonnisskuld te verhaal of gedeeltelik
te verhaal nie regsgeldig is en of dit teen die openbare belang is en tersyde gestel kan
word.
Die appellant het aksie vir skadevergoeding uit hoofde van die beweerde repudiasie
van kontrak teen die tweede, derde en vyfde respondente ingestel. Hy het later die
aksie teen die tweede en derde respondente teruggetrek en is beveel om hulle koste te
betaal. Die getakseerde koste het R52 436,48 beloop. Die appellant het nie die koste
betaal nie waarop die tweede en derde respondente opdrag aan die balju gegee het om
beslag te lê op sy reg, titel en belang in die aksie teen die vyfde respondent (""die
hangende geding""). Die balju, die vierde respondent, het daarop op die appellant se
reg, titel en belang in die aksie teen die vyfde respondent beslag gelê as synde sy
enigste bate en dit in eksekusie verkoop. Die eerste respondent, maatskappy, was die
koper teen koopprys van R300 welke bedrag nie eers die koste van die beslaglegging
en eksekusieverkoping gedek het nie. Die tweede en derde respondente is vader en
seun en die vyfde respondent, die oorblywende verweerder in die hangende geding, is
beslote korporasie waarvan die tweede respondent die enigste lid is. Die eerste
respondent, die eksekusiekoper, is maatskappy wat die tweede en derde respondente
as sy enigste aandeelhouers en direkteure het.
Ten tyde van die verkoping was die hangende geding deels verhoor en het die
verhoorregter reeds aansoek deur die vyfde respondent om absolusie van die instansie
van die hand gewys. Na die eksekusieverkoping het die eerste respondent se
prokureurs die appellant se prokureurs in kennis gestel dat die eerste respondent
reghebbende geword het van die appellant se belang in die hangende geding en opdrag
gegee dat verdere litigasie gestaak moes word. Die appellant het daarop aksie ingestel
teen die respondente vir die tersydestelling van die eksekusieverkoping op grond
daarvan dat dit 'n misbruik van die ""hofprosedure"" daargestel het en contra bonos
mores was. In die onderhawige geval moes die eksekusielasbrief uitgereik word deur

die griffier van die hof en ingevolge die reëls van die hof en moes die
eksekusieverkoping plaasvind ingevolge die reëls van die hof. Vir die rede word die
eksekusieverkoping in die appellant se besonderhede van vordering beskryf as 'n
misbruik van die hofprosedure. Ek verkies om te praat van die regsproses synde die
prosedure wat daargestel is vir die verhaal van 'n geldskuld. Dit sluit dus die
litigasieproses sowel as die eksekusieproses in. Slegs die eerste, tweede, derde en
vyfde respondente het die aksie verdedig. Ek sal voortaan na hulle gesamentlik verwys
as die respondente. Die hof a quo het die appellant se aksie van die hand gewys. Die
uitspraak is gerapporteer as Brummer v Gorfil Brothers Investments (Pty) Ltd1997 (2)
SA 411 (T). Die hof a quo het beslis dat waar eksekusiestappe gedoen word en dit nog
nie volvoer is nie, daar geen twyfel bestaan dat hof in gepaste gevalle daarmee kan
inmeng nie maar dat die posisie anders is waar die eksekusieproses reeds volvoer is. In
laasgenoemde geval sou hof slegs inmeng as daar hersienbare onreëlmatigheid in die
proses was wat die skuldenaar benadeel het. Bybedoelings, bedekte beweegredes of
selfs nydigheid, sou dan nie meer aangevoer kon word as gronde waarop die volvoerde
proses tersyde gestel moes word nie. Met die verlof van hierdie hof appelleer die
appellant teen die uitspraak.
Tydens die voorverhoorsamespreking het die respondente erken dat hulle gesamentlik
besluit het om beslag te laat lê op die appellant se reg, titel en belang in sy eis en om
dit te koop by die eksekusieverkoping. Hulle het verder erken dat hulle hoofbedoeling
was om einde aan die litigasie te maak. In die opdrag aan die balju om voort te gaan
met die eksekusieverkoping het die respondente se prokureurs in opdrag van die
tweede en derde respondente en tot die kennis van die eerste en vyfde respondente,
gesê dat hulle kliënt glo dat die aksie kwelsugtig is. Die afleiding kan gevolglik
gemaak word dat die beslaglegging en eksekusieverkoping nie geskied het met die
doel om die tweede en derde respondente se koste te verhaal nie.
Reg op skadevergoeding uit hoofde van kontrakbreuk is onliggaamlike saak. Dit is
bate in die reghebbende se boedel en kan in die reël deur hom verkoop word en by
wyse van sessie oorgedra word. Na instelling van aksie deur die reghebbende en voor
litis contestatio kan die reg steeds deur hom verkoop en oorgedra word. In die
Romeinse reg was die voorwerp van die oordrag aksie en nie reg nie (Scott, The Law

of Cession, 2de uitgawe, bl.12). By litis contestatio het actio in personam actio
litigiosa geword waarvan die oordrag verbode was (Waikiwi Shipping Co. Ltd. v
Thomas Barlow and Sons (Natal) Ltd.1978 (1) SA 671 (A) (""Waikiwi"") op 676H). In
Waikiwi is die vraag oopgelaat of die Romeinse verbod steeds geld, d.w.s. of die
oordrag van eiser se reg, titel en belang in aksie steeds nie na litis contestatio kon
geskied nie (678F). Dit is egter wel beslis dat indien dit gedoen kon word, gepoogde
vervreemding slegs effektief kon wees tot die mate wat die verweerder nie daardeur
benadeel word nie (678F). Soos uitgewys in Waikiwi op 677G is sedert 1926 in aantal
Suid-Afrikaanse sake óf aanvaar óf aangeneem dat actio litigiosa gesedeer kan word.
In beginsel is daar geen rede om die sessie van reg vóór litis contestatio toe te laat,
maar nie die sessie van die reg, titel en belang van die reghebbende in die aksie,
onderhewig aan die regte van die verweerder, ná litis contestatio nie. Na my mening
geld die Romeinse verbod gevolglik nie meer nie.
Die appellant betoog dat die beslaglegging en verkoping slegs die beslaglegging en
verkoping van spes was, en met beroep op die beslissing in Mears v Pretoria Estate
and Market Co. Ltd 1906 TS 661 op 668, dat spes nie beslaglegbaar is nie. In
Waikiwi, op 677H, is  onderskeid getref tussen die reg ten opsigte waarvan die aksie
ingestel is, die reg wat voorspruit uit litis contestatio om die aksie te volvoer tot sy
einde en die vooruitsig op voordele wat mag voortspruit uit  suksesvolle volvoering
van die aksie of te wel spes. Of bepaalde vervreemding vervreemding is van die reg
ten opsigte waarvan die aksie ingestel is, of slegs van spes, is vraag wat aan die hand
van die feite van die bepaalde geval beantwoord moet word (Waikiwi op 678 in fine).
In die onderhawige geval was die beslaglegging en verkoping nie beslaglegging en
verkoping van die spes of die vooruitsig op die voordele wat die appellant moontlik
kon toeval as gevolg van gunstige volvoering van die hangende geding nie, maar wel
van die appellant se reg, titel en belang in die hangende geding.
Die appellant betoog verder dat alhoewel die tweede en derde respondente beslag kon
lê op sy reg, titel en belang in die hangende geding en dit in eksekusie kon laat
verkoop, hulle dit nie kon doen met die doel om die geding tot 'n einde te bring nie.
So'n oogmerk, is aldus die appellant se betoog, ""ulterior motive"" wat ""die
regmatigheid van andersins regmatige optrede negativeer"". Die appellant voer aan dat

dit uiters onbillik en teen die openbare belang is om so'n verkoping toe te laat. As
gesag steun hy hoofsaaklik op die beslissing in Whitfield v Van Aarde 1993 (1) SA
332 (EC) (""Whitfield"").
In Whitfield het die applikant aansoek gedoen vir die opskorting van
eksekusieverkoping tot 14 dae na die finale afhandeling van aksie deur hom ingestel
teen die respondent. Die aksie was vir skade wat na bewering deur die applikant gely
is as gevolg van nalatige behandeling deur die respondent, neurochirurg. Op die dag
waarop met die verhoor begin sou word, is die aksie op versoek van die applikant
uitgestel omrede een van sy deskundige getuies hom die aand vantevore meegedeel het
dat hy van mening verander het. Die applikant is beveel om die koste te betaal en op
grond van getakseerde kosterekening het die respondent op die applikant se reg, titel
en belang in die aksie teen hom beslag gelê. Nepgen R het beslis dat die hof inherente
diskresie het om eksekusieverkoping op te skort (337F). In dié verband het hy gesteun
op Graham v Graham 1950 (1) SA 655 (T) op 658 waar Clayden R na 'n verwysing
na skuldeiser se reg ingevolge die toepaslike reël om eksekusielasbrief uit te reik, gesê
het:
""the discretion must, I think, still be in the Court to stay the use of its  process
where &#145;real and substantial justice' requires such stay, where injustice
would otherwise be caused.""
Daarbenewens het Nepgen R gesteun op Strime v Strime 1983 (4) SA 850 (C) op
852A met dieselfde strekking; Soja Ltd v Tuckers Land Development
Corporation1981 (2) SA 407 (W) (""Soja"") op 411A-C; Bestbier v Jackson 1986 (3)
SA 482 (W) op 484 I en First Consolidated Leasing Corporation Ltd v Theron 1974
(4) SA 244 (T) op 247.
Ten aansien van die vraag of hy sy diskresie ten gunste van die applikant moes
uitoefen, het Nepgen R gesê (op 339C-G):
""In my judgment a factor which has a considerable bearing on the question of
whether I should exercise my discretion in the applicant's favour is that the
respondent  has little, if any, prospect of obtaining satisfaction of the whole or
any part of the  judgment debt should the sale in execution be allowed to take
place. However, of even  greater importance in this regard is the fact that it is

apparent that the respondent is  not really seeking satisfaction of the judgment.
His motive is to put an end to the  litigation by obtaining possession and control
of the applicant's claim against him.  During the course of argument this was
expressly stated by Mr Buchanan, who appeared on  behalf of the respondent, to
be the respondent's only motive. . . I have no hesitation  whatsoever in coming to
the conclusion that I should exercise my discretion in the  applicant's favour. The
contentions to the contrary, insofar as they relate to the actual  payment of the
costs, advanced on behalf of the respondent are of no significance, once it  is
realised that the respondent's motive is not to recover such costs but to put an
end to  the litigation. This is not a case of a judgment debtor having to pay the
price of  forfeiting his claim in order to put the judgment creditor in possession
of funds which  will go towards satisfying his claim, for the judgment creditor is
not in this case  seeking to obtain such funds. Therefore the reliance the
respondent seeks to place on the  dicta referred to in Madden's case supra and
Marais v Aldridge and Others(supra), is unfounded. The true position is that the
respondent is attempting to make use  of a process of the Court, which is
designed to enable him to obtain satisfaction of the  judgment for costs granted
in his favour, for the purpose of putting an end to the  litigation against him and
for that purpose only. His purpose is therefore an ulterior  one. In this regard it is
in my view appropriate to refer to what was stated by De  Villiers JA in Hudson
v Hudson and Another 1927 AD 259 at 268:
'When therefore, the Court finds an attempt made to use for ulterior
purposes machinery    devised for the better administration of
justice, it is the duty of the Court to prevent    such abuse. But it is a
power which has to be exercised with great caution, and only in a
clear case.'
A clearer case of an abuse of the process of Court than the present one is
difficult to  imagine.""

In Bestbier v Jackson 1986 (3) SA 482 (W), ander beslissing waarop die appellant
steun, het die verweerder op grond van kostebevel vanweë uitstel van die saak op die
eiser se belang in die aksie beslag gelê. Hangende aansoek vir die hersiening van die
taksasie van die betrokke kosterekening het die verweerder opdrag gegee aan die balju
om voort te gaan met die eksekusieverkoping. Die eiser het daarop aansoek gedoen vir
die opskorting van die eksekusieverkoping. Coetzee R het die aansoek toegestaan. Hy
het saamgestem met Nestadt R se beslissing in Sojaop 411A dat hy diskresie het om
so'n bevel te maak. Dit was vir Coetzee R duidelik dat die belang waarop beslag gelê
is geen waarde gehad het vir enigiemand anders as die twee verweerders nie; dat,
indien dit opgeveil sou word, dit verkoop sou word vir feitlik niks nie en dat die eiser
van sy vordering in die saak waarin die kostebevel gemaak is, ontneem sou word. Op
485B-F het hy gesê:
""(T)his kind of execution is something that ought not to be and will not be
encouraged by the Courts. . . . It is perfectly obvious that justice requires that
this  review of taxation be proceeded with, or at least that the applicant be given
an  opportunity to proceed with it, and that, pending that, this rather harassing
sale in  execution of his very cause of action in that action, be stayed.""
Die appellant betoog dat die feit dat, anders as in Whitfield, in die onderhawige geval
reeds verkoping plaasgevind het, nie enige verskil maak nie omrede die tersydestelling
van die eksekusieverkoping nie die regte van onskuldige derdes affekteer nie en dit
moet volg, aldus die betoog, dat indien die beslaglegging teen die openbare belang is,
die verkoping ook teen die openbare belang moet wees.
Enige twyfel wat mag bestaan het oor die bevoegdheid van hof om verkoping in
eksekusie op te skort, is uit die weg geruim deur die bepalings van hofreël 45A wat
uitdruklik bepaal dat die hof die uitvoering van bevel mag opskort vir sodanige
tydperk as wat dit mag goeddink. Waar die vonnisskuldeiser en beslaglegger van eiser
se reg, titel en belang in aksie die verweerder in daardie aksie is, sal die feit dat die
eiser se eis, indien suksesvol, sy vonnisskuld teenoor dieverweerder sal uitwis,
relevante faktor wees wat die hof in die uitoefening van sy diskresie ingevolge reël
45A in ag sal moet neem.
Indien die verweerder teeneis, anders as vonnis maar wat deur die eiser erken word,

teen die eiser gehad het vir die betaling van geldsom, sou die eiser ingevolge reël
22(4) kon vra dat uitspraak ten opsigte van daardie gedeelte van die verweerder se
teeneis wat deur sy eis, indien suksesvol, uitgewis sou word, uitgestel word tot tyd en
wyl uitspraak op sy eis gegee is. Uitspraak op die verweerder se teeneis sou dan in die
geheel of gedeeltelik uitgestel word tensy die hof anders sou beveel. Dit kan duidelik
onbillik teenoor verweerder wees om van hom te verlang om sy skuld aan eiser te
betaal indien dit moontlik uitgewis sal word deur  ongelikwideerde teenvordering
wanneer vonnis ten opsigte daarvan gegee word. Dit is waarskynlik die oorweging wat
aanleiding gegee het tot die aanname van reël 22(4). Dieselfde oorweging geld ook
waar party tot geding kostebevel teen ander party wat ongelikwideerde vordering teen
hom het, wil afdwing. In die onderhawige geval was die beslaglegger natuurlik nie die
verweerder in die betrokke aksie nie.
Inêstwood v Shepstone 1902 TS 294 (""Eastwood"") op 302 het Innes HR gesê:
""Now this Court has the power to treat as void and to refuse in any way to
recognise contracts and transactions which are against public policy or contrary
to good  morals. It is a power not to be hastily or rashly exercised; but when
once it is clear  that any arrangement is against public policy, the Court would be
wanting in its duty if  it hesitated to declare such an arrangement void. What we
have to look to is the tendency  of the proposed transaction, not its actually
proved result.""
Ooreenkomste is ""against public policy"" indien hulle teen die openbare belang is (sien
Sasfin (Pty) Ltd v Beukes 1989 (1) SA 1 (A) (""Sasfin"") op 8A-C). Smalberger AR sê in
Sasfin op 8D:
""Agreements which are clearly inimical to the interests of the community,
whether  they are contrary to law or morality, or run counter to social or
economic expedience,  will accordingly, on the grounds of public policy, not be
enforced"".
Alhoewel normaalweg onderskeid getref word tussen kontrakte wat onwettig of
onafdwingbaar is omrede hulle teen die openbare belang is of omrede hulle contra
bonos mores is, wys Smalberger AR daarop dat die klassifikasie van kontrakte in
kontrakte wat contra bonos mores is en kontrakte wat teen die openbare belang is,

omruilbaar is, en dat wanneer hof weier om kontrak af te dwing dit per slot van
rekening gedoen word op grond van die openbare belang (8E-F). Vir dié rede is die
feit dat die appellant in sy besonderhede van vordering beweer het dat die verkoping
contra bonos mores was, maar betoog het dat dit teen die openbare belang was, van
geen belang nie.
Die waarskuwing inêstwood om nie te geredelik te weier om erkenning aan kontrak of
transaksie te verleen op grond daarvan dat dit teen die openbare belang sou wees om
dit te doen nie, is weer eens beklemtoon in Sasfin. Smalberger AR sê in dié verband
op 9 B en E:
""No court should ... shrink from the duty of declaring a contract contrary to
public policy when the occasion so demands. The power to declare contracts
contrary to  public policy should, however, be exercised sparingly and only in
the clearest of cases,  lest uncertainty as to the validity of contracts result from
an arbitrary and  indiscriminate use of the power. One must be careful not to
conclude that a contract is  contrary to public policy merely because its terms (or
some of them) offend one's  individual sense of propriety and fairness. . . .In
grappling with this often difficult  problem it must be borne in mind that public
policy generally favours the utmost freedom  of contract, and requires that
commercial transactions should not be unduly trammelled by  restrictions on that
freedom.""
Faktor wat in ag geneem moet word by die beoordeling van die vraag of transaksie
teen die openbare belang is al dan nie, is dat die openbare belang ook gedien word
deur ""simple justice between man and man"" (sien Sasfin op 9G en ook per Van
Heerden AR op 28A-B; sien ook Botha (now Griessel) v Finanscredit (Pty) Ltd 1989
(3) SA 773 (A) op 783A-B).
Ek handel eers met die vraag of die beslaglegging en eksekusieverkoping met die doel
om die hangende geding te beëindig en nie om 'n vonnisskuld, synde die tweede en
derde respondente se getakseerde koste, te verhaal nie, 'n misbruik van die regsproses
daargestel het.
In Hunter v Chief Constable of West Midlands and Another[1981] 3 All ER 727 (HL)
(""Hunter"") het Lord Diplock gesê op 729:

""My Lords, this is a case about abuse of the process of the High Court. It
concerns the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent
misuse of  its procedure in a way which, although not inconsistent with the
literal application of  its procedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly
unfair to a party to litigation  before it, or would otherwise bring the
administration of justice into disrepute among  right-thinking people. The
circumstances in which abuse of process can arise are very  varied; those which
give rise to the instant appeal must surely be unique. It would, in my  view, be
most unwise if this House were to use this occasion to say anything that might be
taken as limiting to fixed categories the kinds of circumstances in which the
court has a  duty (I disavow the word discretion) to exercise this salutary power.""
Wat in bepaalde geval as misbruik van die regsproses in Engeland beskou mag word,
sal natuurlik nie noodwendig as sodanig in Suid-Afrika beskou word nie. Die beginsel
hierbo aangehaal en waarop die saak beslis is, is egter dieselfde beginsel as waaraan
erkenning verleen is in Hudson waarna in Whitfield verwys is en wat ook hierbo
aangehaal is. In Hudson het die eiser eksepsie opgewerp teen tweede verweerder se
verweerskrif op dieselfde basis as waarop eksepsie onsuksesvol geneem is teen die
eerste verweerder se verweerskrif. Die hof het bevind dat dit gedoen is slegs om uitstel
te verkry en dat dit misbruik van die regsproses was. Die eksepsie is gevolglik
geskrap. Die respondente het gepoog om Hudson te onderskei op die basis dat die
eiser in Hudson geen bedoeling gehad het om eksepsie op te werp nie terwyl die
bedoeling in die onderhawige geval wel was om op die betrokke reg beslag te lê en dit
in eksekusie te verkoop. In Hudson is geen aanduiding te vinde dat die beslissing
enigsins anders sou gewees het indien die eiser, ten einde uitstel te verkry, van
voorneme was om deur die futiele oefening, om sy eksepsie te argumenteer, te gaan
nie. Dit blyk ook nie dat die hof van mening was dat dit nie die bedoeling van die eiser
was nie. Dit is nietemin, aldus die respondente, die basis waarop die beslissing in
Hudson versoen moet word met die beslissing in Tsose v Minister of Justice 1951 (3)
SA 10 (A) (""Tsose""). In Tsose het Schreiner AR op 17G-H gesê
""For just as the best motive will not cure an otherwise illegal arrest so the  worst
motive will not render an otherwise legal arrest illegal.""

Tsose is gearresteer op klagte dat hy onwettig op plaas was. Die saak teen hom is
uitgestel en hy is op borgtog vrygelaat. Daarna en voor die datum waarna die saak
uitgestel is, is hy weer eens gearresteer. Die saak is na dieselfde datum as die vorige
een uitgestel maar geen borgtog is aan hom verleen nie. Hy het aansoek gedoen vir
interdik wat die polisie sou verbied om hom te arresteer op klagte van betreding terwyl
ander klagte van betreding hangende was. Dit was nie betwis dat die polisie te kenne
gegee het dat hulle sou voortgaan om hom te arresteer wanneer ookal hy op die plaas
gevind word tot tyd en wyl hy die plaas verlaat het nie. Die vraag was of hierdie
motief die arres onregmatig gemaak het. Schreiner AR het ten aansien van hierdie
vraag beslis op 17 C- E:
""If the object of the arrest, though professedly to bring the arrested person
before the court, is really not such, but is to frighten or harass him and so induce
him  to act in a way desired by the arrestor, without his appearing in court, the
arrest is, no  doubt, unlawful. But if the object of the arrestor is to bring the
arrested person before  the court in order that he may be prosecuted to conviction
and so may be led to cease to  contravene the law the arrest is not rendered
illegal because the arrestor's motive is to  frighten or harass the arrested person
into desisting from his illegal conduct.""
Tsose is geen gesag vir die proposisie dat waar die prosedurereëls van die hof
aangewend word ten einde ander doel te bereik as waarvoor hulle bestem is, hof niks
daaromtrent kan doen nie. Die arrestasies was waarskynlik wettige arrestasies
ingevolge die Strafproseswet 31 van 1917 wat op daardie stadium gegeld het en is nie
gedoen ingevolge die prosedurereëls van die hof nie. Hulle is gevolglik nie geraak
deur die beginsel waarna in Hudson en Hunter verwys is nie.
In Estate Logie v Priest 1926 AD 312 (""Estate Logie"") het die hof beslis dat dit nie
onbehoorlik van krediteur was om aansoek te doen vir die sekwestrasie van sy
skuldenaar se boedel met die doel om betaling van sy skuld te kry en nie om concursus
creditorum te bewerkstellig nie. Die hof was van mening dat die beweegrede van
persone wat sekwestrasieverrigtinge aanhangig maak normaalweg was om betaling van
hulle skuld te verkry en dat hulle nie beïnvloed word deur altruïstiese oorwegings of
besorgdheid oor ander skuldeisers wat hulle eie belange kan behartig nie (319). Die

hof was gevolglik van mening dat die regsproses nie misbruik is nie. In sy uitspraak
het Solomon AR verwys na King v Henderson [1898] AC 720 (""King""). Volgens
Solomon AR (op 320) is in King beslis dat ""it is neither fraud nor an abuse of the
powers of the Court to petition for a sequestration order with an indirect motive, that
is, for a purpose other than the equal distribution of the testator's assets, as, for
example, to exclude the appellant from a partnership"". Hierdie passasie was egter nie
bedoel om te sê dat motief of doel nooit ter sake is nie en dit is ook nie hoe Solomon
AR dit verstaan het nie. Al wat in King beslis is, is dat motief op sigself nie misbruik
van die regsproses daarstel nie. Lord Watson het op 731 gesê:
""In the opinion of their Lordships, mere motive, however reprehensible, will not
be sufficient for that purpose (to constitute an abuse of process or a fraud on the
Court); it must be shewn that, in the circumstances in which the interposition of
the  Court is sought, the remedy would be unsuitable, and would enable the
person obtaining it  fraudulently to defeat the rights of others, whether legal or
equitable.""
[Die gedeelte tussen hakies is deur my ingevoeg.]
Ter illustrasie het Lord Watson verwys na Ex parte Gallimore 2 Rose 424
(""Gallimore""); Ex parte Wilbran 5 Madd. 1 (""Wilbran""); In re Davies 3 Ch. D. 461
(""Davies"")en Ex parte Griffin 12 Ch. D. 480 (""Griffin""). In Gallimore is
sekwestrasieverrigtinge tersyde gestel nieteenstaande die feit dat al die vereistes
aanwesig was omrede die applikant indirekte en onbehoorlike doel gehad het, naamlik
die beëindiging van huurkontrak. Dit is beskou as gebruik van die prosedure vir
bedrieglike doel (Kingop 732). Na verwysing na en goedkeuring van die stelling in
Wilbran dat ""the courts of justice had no concern with the motives of parties who
asserted a legal right"" het Lord Watson op 732 gesê:
""Motive cannot in itself constitute fraud, although it may incite the person who
entertains it to adopt proceedings which, if successful, would necessarily lead to
a  fraudulent result; and it is not the motive, but the course of procedure which
leads to  that result, which the law regards as constituting fraud.""
(My kursivering.)
Hierdie passasie is met oënskynlike goedkeuring deur Solomon AR aangehaal in

Estate Logie (320).
In In re Majory [1955] Ch 600 op 623-624 het Evershed M.R., Jenkins en Romer L.JJ.
na verwysing na verskeie gewysdes, ook Wilbran, gesê dat daar algemene reël is ""that
court proceedings may not be used or threatened for the purpose of obtaining for the
person so using or threatening them some collateral advantage to himself, and not for
the purpose for which such proceedings are properly designed and exist; and a party
so using or threatening proceedings will be liable to be held guilty of abusing the
process of the court and therefor disqualified from invoking the powers of the court by
proceedings he has abused."" Die beginsel dat die regsproses misbruik word wanneer
dit gebruik word vir doel waarvoor dit nie bestem is nie word ook in Australië erken
(sien Packer v Meagher [1984] 3 NSWLR 486 op 492 en T J M Products (Pty) Ltd v
A & P Tyres (Pty) Ltd [1988] 78 ALR 579 (Federal Court) op 585).
Sedert die beslissing in Hudson is ook in verskeie Suid- Afrikaanse beslissings
geweier om toe te laat dat die regsproses misbruik word deur die aanwending daarvan
vir 'n doel waarvoor dit nie bestem is nie (vgl Janit v Motor Industry Fund
Administrators (Pty) Ltd 1995 (4) SA293 (A) op 308G; Beinash v Wixley 1997 (3) SA
721 (SCA) (""Beinash"") op 734G).
In Beinash moes die hof beslis of die uitreiking van 'n getuiedagvaarding 'n misbruik
van die regsproses was. Mahomed HR sê op 734 F-G:
""What does constitute an abuse of the process of the Court is a matter which
needs  to be determined by the circumstances of each case. There can be no
all-encompassing  definition of the concept of 'abuse of process'.  It can be said
in general terms,  however, that an abuse of process takes place where the
procedures permitted by the Rules  of the Court to facilitate the pursuit of the
truth are used for a purpose extraneous to  that objective. ... A subpoena duces
tecummust have a legitimate purpose.""
In Standard Credit Corporation Ltd v Bester 1987 (1) SA 812 (W) is in nog meer
algemene terme gesê (op 820A-B):
""In general terms, however, an abuse of the process of the court can be said to
take place when its procedure is used by a litigant for a purpose for which it was
not  intended or designed, to the prejudice or potential prejudice of the other

party to the  proceedings.""
In Goldsmith v Sperrings Ltd [1977] 2 All ER 566 [CA] was die vraag of sekere aksies
misbruik van die regsproses daargestel het. Scarman LJ het die toets soos volg
geformuleer op 582c:
""In the instant proceedings the defendants have to show that the plaintiff has an
ulterior motive, seeks a collateral advantage for himself beyond what the law
offers, is  reaching out &#145;to effect an object not within the scope of the
process': Grainger  v Hill (1838) 4 Bing NC 212 at 221 per Tindal CJ. In a
phrase, the plaintiff's  purpose has to be shown to be not that which the law by
granting a remedy offers to  fulfil, but one which the law does not recognise as a
legitimate use of the remedy sought:  ...""
Dit is nie net die hoofdoel waarvoor 'n spesifieke regsproses bestem is wat geoorloof
is nie en ek meen nie dat die voormelde formulerings van die toets om te bepaal of 'n
aanwending van die regsproses 'n misbruik daarvan is, verstaan moet word om te sê
dat dit die geval is nie. Die aanwending van 'n regsproses vir 'n doel anders as die
spesifieke doel waarvoor dit bestem is, kan nietemin redelik wees. Dit sal die geval
wees indien daardie doel binne die breë bestek van die betrokke regsproses val. So
byvoorbeeld kan in sekere omstandighede aansoek gedoen word vir 'n bevel dat die
eiser sekuriteit vir koste verskaf. 'n Verweerder wat so 'n aansoek doen met die doel
om 'n einde aan die litigasie te maak, maak nietemin redelike gebruik van die betrokke
regsproses omrede sy doel binne die breë bestek van die betrokke regsproses val. Dit
is in die woorde van Mahomed HR 'n ""legitimate purpose"". Daarteenoor, indien dit
onredelik is om die regsproses vir sodanige doel te gebruik, word dit misbruik. Dit sal
die geval wees indien die regsproses gebruik word vir 'n doel wat geen verband hou
met die doel waarvoor dit bestem is nie.
In King, Wilbran en Estate Logie was die hof nie van mening dat die regsproses
onbehoorlik aangewend is nie. In beide Wilbran en Kingis beslis dat sekwestrasie om
die vennootskap wat aan die applikant geld skuld te ontbind eenvoudig bymotief was
wat geen misbruik van die prosedure daargestel het nie. In Estate Logie is na my
mening heeltemal tereg bevind dat die aanwending van die sekwestrasieprosedure ten
einde betaling van geldskuld te bekom nie onbehoorlike aanwending van daardie

prosedure was nie.
Weer eens word nie te kenne gegee dat wat elders beskou is as misbruik van die
regsproses ook in Suid-Afrika so beskou sal word nie. Opvattings verander van tyd tot
tyd en van gemeenskap tot gemeenskap Die uitwinningsprosedure vervat in die
hofreëls is bestem om gebruik te word om vonnisskuld te verhaal. In die onderhawige
geval het die respondente die uitwinningsproses ten opsigte van die appellant se reg,
titel en belang in die hangende geding teen die vyfde respondent aangewend, nie om
die appellant se vonnisskulde teenoor die tweede en derde respondente of gedeelte
daarvan te verhaal nie, maar wel om sodanige reg, titel en belang te bekom ten einde
die litigasie te beëindig.
Die respondente betoog dat soortgelyke optrede goedgekeur is in die sake Marais v
Aldridge 1976 (1) SA 746 (T) (""Marais""), Madden v BP Southern Africa (Pty) Ltd
1967 (2) SA 326 (D) (""Madden""), Mahabeer v Rajpathi 1961 (4) SA 269 (D)
(""Mahabeer"")en Klisser v Gold 1961 (1) SA 821 (D) (""Klisser""). Na my mening is dit
nie so nie.
In Marais het derde party op eiser se belang in aksie beslag laat lê en is dit in
eksekusie verkoop aan die verweerder in die aksie. Enige samespanning tussen die
derde party en die verweerder is ontken. Daar was geen suggestie dat die derde party
nie gepoog het om die eiser se vonnisskuld teenoor hom te verhaal nie. Onder die
omstandighede stem ek saam met die stelling van Melamet R wat die saak beslis het,
dat dit nie saak maak dat die koper die reg van die eiser om met die aksie voort te
gaan, sou frustreer nie (750C). Die uitwinningsprosedure is nie misbruik nie. Die
derde party het dit gebruik om sy vonnisskuld te verhaal.
In Madden het die respondent beslag laat lê op die applikant se belang in die uitslag
van appèl wat die applikant aangeteken het teen vonnis ten gunste van die respondent
betreffende die applikant se reg op okkupasie van sekere persele. Die applikant het
aansoek gedoen vir opskorting van die eksekusieverkoping op grond daarvan dat die
respondent sy reg kon inkoop en die appèl kon frustreer. Miller R het soos volg beslis
(328 A-C):
""It seems to me to be correct that in the event of Mr. Friedman's clients
purchasing this particular asset, namely the interest which the judgment debtor

has in the  appeal presently pending, he could in effect frustrate the applicant's
whole intent and  purpose, which is to have the decision of this Court set aside
by a higher tribunal. It  does not follow, of course, that the judgment creditor
will acquire this right at the sale  in execution but, even if he does and decides to
utilise his right in a way which would  frustrate the applicant's right of appeal,
that is merely one of the incidents of the sale  in execution; it is part of the price
which the judgment debtor, who cannot pay his  creditor in any other way, has to
pay in order to put the judgment creditor in possession  of funds which will go
towards satisfying his claim. No other ground has been advanced by  the
applicant why the advertised sale should be stayed nor am I aware of any.""
Dit is dus nie aangevoer dat die uitwinningsprosedure nie aangewend word om skuld
te verhaal nie. Wat die effek sou wees indien dit die geval was, is gevolglik nooit deur
die hof oorweeg nie.
Ook in Klisser en Mahabeer, waarin die applikante aansoek gedoen het vir bevele wat
die balju magtig om op hul teenpartye se belange in die betrokke gedinge beslag te lê,
is nie aangevoer dat die uitwinningsprosedure nie aangewend word vir die doel
waarvoor dit bestem is nie en dat dit gevolglik misbruik van die regsproses daargestel
het nie.
Alhoewel die sake waarna hierbo verwys is en waarin gehandel word met 'n misbruik
van die regsproses, meestal handel met 'n misbruik van die resproses insoverre dit
betrekking het op die litigasieproses,bestaan daar na my mening geen logiese rede of
beginsel op grond waarvan 'n hof se plig om 'n misbruik van die ""machinery devised
for the better administration of justice"" (synde die woorde gebruik in Hudson) te
voorkom, beperk behoort te word tot die litigasieproses nie en waarom dit nie ook
moet geld ten opsigte van die eksekusieproses nie.
Dit is onwaarskynlik dat enigiemand anders as verweerder, of vriend van die
verweerder, of persoon wat belang in die verweerder het (hierna handlanger genoem),
met die doel om einde aan die litigasie te maak, op eiser se eis teen die verweerder sal
laat beslag lê en dit sal koop op die eksekusieverkoping. So'n aanwending van die
eksekusieproses is aanwending daarvan vir doel wat geen verband hou met die doel
waarvoor die uitwinningsproses bestem is nie. Daar is ander prosedures wat gevolg

kan word om eiser aan bande te lê indien beweer word dat die verrigtinge deur hom
ingestel, kwelsugtig is. So'n aanwending van die uitwinningsproses is verder
aanwending daarvan wat onbillik teenoor   verweerder kan wees en wat die
regsadministrasie in swak lig kan stel. Indien dit toegelaat word, kan enige kostebevel
of enige ander skuld van  minvermoënde eiser teenoor die verweerder of handlanger of
'n skuld wat deur die verweerder of handlanger bekom kan word, fataal wees vir die
eiser se eis. Dit kan meebring dat hy, omrede hy nie skuld kan betaal nie, sy eis
ontneem word sonder dat sy skuld enigsins verminder word en dít deur die
aanwending van prosedure wat nie vir daardie doel bestem is nie. Dit is so omrede
litigasie baie duur en uitgerekte proses kan wees en in baie gevalle, veral waarskynlik
waar die eiser minvermoënde, ongesofistikeerde persoon is; die verweerder
vermoënde persoon is; die eis hand en tand beveg word en die bewys daarvan afhang
van die eiser se getuienis, daar hoegenaamd geen mark vir daardie eis sal wees nie.
Indien so'n proses toegelaat word, word die minvermoënde eiser, indien hy 'n fout in
die geding deur hom ingestel sou maak wat 'n kostebevel teen hom tot gevolg het,
uitgelewer aan die genade van die verweerder. Die feite in Whitfield illustreer die
onbillike resultate wat sulke optrede tot gevolg kan hê. In die onderhawige geval het
die appellant, wat met regshulp litigeer en wat geen ander bates gehad het waarop
beslag gelê kon word nie, dan ook sy eis verloor sonder dat sy vonnisskuld teenoor die
tweede en derde respondente verminder het. Aan die ander kant sal dit geensins
onbillik wees om nie die verweerder of derde toe te laat om so op te tree nie. Al wat
van hulle verlang word, is om nie die regsproses te gebruik vir doel waarvoor dit nie
bestem is nie.
Vir die voormelde redes is ek van mening dat die beslaglegging op appellant se reg,
titel en belang met die doel om dit by die eksekusieverkoping te koop ten einde einde
aan die litigasie te maak en nie om die onderliggende vonnisskuld te verhaal nie,
misbruik van die uitwinningsproses was wat nie toegelaat behoort te word nie.
Dit is betoog dat selfs indien die beslaglegging tersyde gestel kon word dit nie meer
die geval was toe die verkoping plaasgevind het nie. Aldus die betoog moes die
appellant aansoek gedoen het vir die opskorting van die tenuitvoerlegging van die
hofbevel. Nieteenstaande die feit dat die appellant nie aansoek gedoen het vir die

opskorting van die beslaglegging nie, was die eksekusieverkoping integrale deel van
die misbruik wat van die uitwinningsproses gemaak is. Die misbruik is van so 'n aard
en die gevolge daarvan is sodanig dat dit teen die openbare belang is om dit toe te laat.
Die verkoping as sulks was gevolglik teen die openbare belang In Sookdeyi v Sahadeo
1952 (4) SA 568 (A) op 572A verwys Van den Heever AR na die traagheid, volgens
ons gewysdes, om met eksekusieverkopings wat reeds uitgevoer is in te meng. Hy
noem egter ook dat hulle in sekere uitsonderlike gevalle aangeveg kan word. Daar kan
na my mening geen rede bestaan waarom eksekusieverkoping wat teen die openbare
belang is nie tersydegestel kan word as geen onskuldige derdes deur so'n
tersydestelling geraak sal word nie.
Ek meen gevolglik dat die appèl behoort te slaag en dat die eksekusieverkoping
tersyde gestel behoort te word.

Criminal Procedure - Special entry - Re-opening of State case
J U D G M E N T
VIVIER  JA

VIVIER JA:
This is an appeal on a special entry in terms of secs 317 and 318 of
the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of l977 (“the Act”).     The appellant and one
Agnew were convicted in the Cape Provincial Division by Foxcroft J and
assessors on a charge of murder and the appellant was, in addition,
convicted of theft.  The appellant was sentenced to  an effective  sixteen
years’ imprisonment.   His application for leave to appeal against his
convictions was refused by the Court a quo and a petition to the Chief
Justice was unsuccessful.
The special entry was made under the following circumstances.
During the trial, after both the State and the defence had closed their cases
but before argument commenced, the State applied to reopen its case so as
to lead the evidence of a pharmacist, one Albert,  relating to the exact time

Denis Marock   (“the deceased”) visited the  pharmacy on  the day he was
killed which was  Tuesday 4 October 1994.    Despite objection by the
defence the State was allowed to lead the evidence.    Immediately after
Albert had testified the presiding Judge made the following special entry on
application by the defence -
“Whether or not the order allowing the State to reopen its case,
withdraw an admission and to lead evidence as to the time the
State witness Albert saw the deceased on  4 October 1994
after the close of the defence case was irregular or not
according to law.”
The State case was that the deceased was killed during the late
afternoon of  4 October 1994  in the warehouse of a firm called  Bi-Lo
Wholesalers in Albert Road,  Woodstock, by a hired killer or killers acting
for reward at the instigation of the appellant and Agnew.     The deceased
was  killed   with  a  pickaxe  handle or similar  blunt  object.         There

was no direct evidence as to what happened in the warehouse or how
exactly the deceased met his death.    It was not in issue that the deceased
was seen alive in the warehouse at about 17h00 that afternoon.   The
appellant’s evidence was that he met the deceased and Agnew at the
warehouse at about 16h30 that afternoon and that he left the warehouse
together with the deceased at ten minutes to five.     Thornhill-Fisher, who
testified on behalf of Agnew and whose evidence was accepted as reliable
by the trial Court,   said that he saw the appellant talking to the deceased in
the warehouse at about 17h00.    The State witness  Sharon Reynolds, who
lived with the deceased, said that the deceased left  their house at half past
two that afternoon for an  appointment with his attorney at three o’clock
after which he intended calling  at a pharmacy to get his medication for his
eczema before attending a meeting with the appellant and Agnew at the
warehouse.   She never saw him alive again.   His body was discovered a

week later in the boot of his car in an open field some distance from the
warehouse.
Albert is the owner of a pharmacy near the warehouse and did not
originally testify during  the State case.      In an affidavit deposed to by him
on 10 March 1995 and  handed in by consent as part of the State case, he
said that the deceased arrived at the pharmacy at five minutes to five that
afternoon, that he purchased his normal monthly medication on a repeat
prescription  and that he left the pharmacy at about  five minutes past five.
Albert was able to determine the time of the deceased’s visit to the
pharmacy from the computer clock time  printed on the invoice of the sale,
which shows the time of the sale as 17h12.   Albert stated in his affidavit
that when he made the affidavit on 10 March 1995 he checked the accuracy
of the computer clock and found it to be ten minutes out.   He thus
calculated that the real time he attended to the deceased was 17h02  and not

17h12  as indicated on the invoice.
Albert’s  time conflicted with the evidence I have referred to above.
It was for that reason that the State applied to reopen its case and to  lead
Albert’s evidence in order to show that the times stated in his affidavit could
be wrong.   Albert then testified that when he was first approached by the
police he had no independent recollection of the time of the deceased’s visit
to the pharmacy and that he was only able to fix the time from the computer
clock time printed on the invoice.   During the week before he testified  he
was again approached by the police who wanted to know whether it was
possible that the deceased’s visit to his pharmacy was  earlier than what he
had stated in his affidavit.   He then re-examined  his computer records and
found the so-called audit trail in respect of the day in question.  This is a
computer print out reflecting the day’s entire  transactions and the times
thereof.   This document, which was handed in at the trial, shows the last

sale for the day in question to have taken place at 18h53.    Albert testified
that this time was without a doubt  wrong as it is his invariable practice to
close the pharmacy at 18h00 every weekday.   This meant that on the day
in question his computer clock was at least 53 minutes  and not 10 minutes
out as he had previously thought so that the sale to the deceased had taken
place at 16h19 instead of  17h02  as stated in his affidavit.   Albert said that
he again checked his computer clock on the day he testified in Court (2 April
1996) when it was 23 minutes out.  The State thereafter called Wayne
Bouwer from the computer firm who services Albert’s computer clock.
His evidence was that the computer is a very old one with a very old battery
and that it was last serviced on 23 November 1994.   He said that as the
battery gets older the clock would lose time, as much as 24 hours.
After the State had lead the evidence of Albert and Bouwer, the
defence was afforded an opportunity to lead further evidence.  Counsel for

the appellant then recalled the investigating officer for further cross-
examination,  successfully applied for Agnew to be recalled in terms of sec
167 of the Act and also recalled the appellant.    The latter merely confirmed
what had taken place at the inspection in loco.
It is quite clear that Albert’s evidence as to the time of the deceased’s
visit to his pharmacy  is completely unreliable and should be ignored.    In
its judgment on the merits the trial Court found it to be so and had no regard
to it.
Sec 317(1) of the Act provides that if an accused person considers
that any of the proceedings in connection with or during his trial before a
superior Court are irregular or not according to law, he may apply for a
special entry to be made on the record.   Sec 318(1) provides that if a special
entry is made on the record,  the person convicted may appeal to this Court
against his conviction on the ground of the irregularity or illegality stated in

the special entry.    In considering the appeal regard must be had to the
proviso to sec 322(1) of the Act, in terms of which the accused’s conviction
and sentence are not to be set aside by reason of any irregularity or defect
in the record or proceedings, unless it appears to this Court  that a failure of
justice has in fact resulted from such irregularity or defect.
Generally speaking, an irregularity or illegality in the proceedings at
a criminal  trial occurs whenever there is a departure from those formalities,
rules and principles of procedure with which the law requires such a trial to
be initiated and conducted.    The basic concept underlying sec 317(1) is that
an accused must be fairly tried (per   Botha JA   in  S v Xaba 1983(3) SA
717 (A) at 728 D).
As to the question whether there has been a failure of justice, this
Court has in a number of decisions recognised that in an exceptional case the
irregularity may be of such a kind that it  per se  results in a failure of justice

vitiating the proceedings,   as in   S v Moodie 1961(4) SA 752 (A) and  S v
Mushimba en Andere 1977(2) SA 829 (A).    Where the irregularity is not
of such a nature that it  per se  results in a failure of justice, the test to be
applied to determine whether there has been a failure of justice is simply
whether the Court hearing the appeal considers, on the evidence (and
credibility findings, if any)  unaffected by the irregularity or defect, that there
is proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.   If it does so consider, there was
no resultant failure of justice   (per Holmes JA  in  S v Tuge 1966(4) SA
565 (A) at 568 F-G;   and see also S v Xaba, supra,  at 736 A-B and  S v
Nkata and Others 1990(4) SA 250 (A) at 257 E-F.)
The first question which thus arises for decision in the present case
is whether the trial Court’s ruling allowing the reopening of the State case
constituted an irregularity within the meaning of sec 317(1) of the Act.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that it did so and that it was, moreover,

an irregularity of the kind which per se vitiated the proceedings.
That a trial Court has a general discretion in both civil and criminal
cases to allow a party who has closed his case to reopen it and to lead
evidence at any time up to judgment is beyond doubt.   The proper approach
is that the Court’s discretion should be exercised judicially upon a
consideration of all the facts of each particular case, having due regard to the
considerations mentioned in the cases and applying them as guidelines and
not as inflexible rules.    In  Mkwanazi  v  Van der Merwe and Another
1970(1) SA 609 (A)   Holmes JA   stated the correct approach thus at 616
B-D :
“It is inappropriate for judicial decisions to lay down
immutable conditions which have to be satisfied before the
relief sought can be granted.    Over the years the Courts have
indicated certain guiding considerations or factors, but they
must not be regarded as inflexible requirements, or as being

individually decisive.    Some are more cogent than others; but
they should all be weighed in the scales, the pros against the
cons.”
Mkwanazi’s   case was concerned with Rule 28 (1) of the
Magistrates’ Court Act 32 of 1944 but, as Holmes JA pointed out at 616 D
in his majority judgment, the Supreme Court has, inherently, much the same
discretion to allow evidence before judgment.    The majority of this Court
held on the facts of that case that fresh evidence should have been admitted
by the magistrate after both sides had closed their cases even though there
was no satisfactory explanation as to why the evidence had not been led
before.   The omission to lead the evidence was, however, not deliberate and
there was no prejudice to the other side.
In Hladhla v President Insurance Co Ltd 1965 (1) SA 614 (A) this
Court held that new evidence in that case should have been allowed after the

argument stage.     In his judgment (at 621 E-G)   Van Blerk JA referred to
the danger mentioned by Wigmore, para 1878 that to make a general
practice of introducing new evidence when, after argument, it is found where
the shoe pinches, may lead to perjury.     Van Blerk JA then pointed out,
however, that Wigmore in the same passage goes on to say that :
“Nevertheless, situations might easily arise in which an honest
purpose may justly be served, without unfair disadvantage, by
admitting evidence at this stage, and it has always been
conceded that the trial Court’s discretion should not be
hampered by an inflexible rule.”
With regard to the test to be applied to an application to reopen see
further :   Oosthuizen v Stanley 1938 AD 322 at 333 and Barclays Western
Bank Ltd v Gunas and Another 1981(3) SA 91 (N) at 95 C - 96 H.
The considerations mentioned by the Courts include the following:
the reason why the evidence was not led timeously, the degree of materiality

of the evidence, the possibility that it may have been shaped to relieve the
pinch of the shoe, the possible prejudice to the other side, including such
factors as the fact that a witness who could testify in rebuttal may no longer
be available, the stage which the proceedings have reached and the general
need for finality.
In the present case Albert’s evidence that the error in his computer
clock was greater than that mentioned in his affidavit was clearly material
to the case as it affected the time of the deceased’s visit to the pharmacy.
When the police first approached Albert for a statement on   10 March 1995
there was no reason for him to doubt the ten minute discrepancy which he
then discovered in the computer clock and it was accordingly unnecessary
for him to investigate the matter any further.    It was only when Albert’s
time was considered in the light of the other evidence that a doubt arose as
to its accuracy.    In my view, accordingly, there was a satisfactory

explanation before the trial Court as to why Albert’s evidence that the
computer clock was 53 minutes instead of 10 minutes out was not led in the
first place.
In the light of the above decisions there is no room for the absolute
rule contended for by counsel for the appellant namely that the trial Court’s
discretion to admit evidence for the State after the close of the defence case
should be limited to where new matter is introduced which the State could
not foresee.        An inflexible rule of this kind hampers the trial judge’s
discretion and cannot be supported.    In each case it is a matter for the trial
judge’s discretion whether, on the facts of that case and applying as
guidelines the considerations mentioned in the cases,   the new evidence
could be allowed without injustice to the accused.
With regard to the question of possible prejudice counsel for the
appellant submitted that an accused is inevitably prejudiced when the State

case is reopened since he may then be compelled to testify to answer the
new evidence.   I do not agree.     An accused is never compelled to testify.
His right to remain silent remains unaffected.  In the present case the
defence was given the opportunity to lead further evidence but the appellant
was not compelled to testify.   Counsel for the appellant further submitted
that in a trial of more than one accused, prejudice to any accused will
inevitably result if a co-accused is recalled by the court under sec 167 of the
Act, as happened in the present case.    Again I am unable to agree.    Apart
from the fact that his co-accused was recalled by the trial Court at the
request of the appellant’s counsel so that the appellant could not have been
prejudiced, his right to remain silent was unaffected by the recall of his co-
accused.      He himself  elected to testify again.
In considering the question of possible prejudice to the appellant it is
necessary to refer to the facts of the case.  These may be briefly stated as

follows.       The deceased and one Abramowitz were partners in various
business ventures and they took out life policies in excess of  R1 m on each
other’s lives.    Their relationship soured so that when Abramowitz formed
Bi-Lo Wholesalers in  December 1993 he would not give the deceased a
share in the new business but allowed him  to sell franchises for the
business.         Agnew was a manufacturer of household chemicals and was
allowed to process raw materials purchased by Bi-Lo in its  warehouse.
The appellant is an accountant.    His estate was finally sequestrated in
February 1994 and he had no meaningful employment from then until he was
employed by Abramowitz in January 1994 as the general manager of Bi-Lo.
The appellant was aware of  the life policy which Abramowitz had on the
life of the deceased.
It was not disputed that the appellant made various attempts  over a
period of time  to find a hired killer to kill the deceased for reward.     A

number of State witnesses gave evidence to that effect and their evidence
was not challenged.        Renzo Ceccarelli, who  had lost about half a million
rand which he had invested in the appellant’s trust account, before his
sequestration,  testified that during  May and  August 1994   the appellant
more than once  asked him to find someone who would kill the deceased.
Ceccarelli was promised  the sum of  R100 000  if  the deceased was killed.
Ceccarelli contacted Vincent Bracale whom he introduced to the appellant.
A few days later the appellant told him that Bracale’s fee of  R60 000 was
too high.     Ceccarelli thereafter approached  Moggamat  Jordan whose fee
was  R20 000 of which R10 000 had to be paid in advance.           Ceccarelli
obtained the R10 000 from the appellant and handed it to Moggamat who
disappeared with the money.   During October 1994 the appellant came to
Ceccarelli’s flat and told him that the job had been done in a factory.
Ceccarelli’s evidence  was fully corroborated by Bracale and Jordan.

Bracale testified that the appellant told him about the life policies and that
he  would share in the proceeds received by Abramowitz.
Agnew, Willem Adriaan Smit and Philip Lloyd were partners in a
small business.     Smit was originally an accused in this matter but he took
his own life shortly before the start of the trial.    Lloyd testified that he
heard from Agnew that he was looking for a hired killer and that he told
Smit about it.     At about  17h30  on 4 October 1994 Smit arrived at his
home and handed him the sum of R5 000.   Smit asked him for a saw.
When Smit opened the boot of his car he observed the handle of a pickaxe
protruding from a plastic bag in the boot.
A number of employees at the warehouse testified that on 4 October
1994 the appellant told them to go home early as there was to be a meeting
at the warehouse that afternoon.    They all left the warehouse before  three
o’clock.    The next morning they noticed that the  carpet in the office  had

been removed and Agnew explained that chemicals had been spilt on the
carpet.    Agnew testified that he found blood on the office floor on the night
of 4 October 1994.
In his evidence at the trial the appellant admitted the substance of the
evidence given by Ceccarelli,    Bracale and Jordan.    His defence was that
it was Abramowitz and not he who wanted to kill the deceased  and that he
acted under duress from Abramowitz in his attempts to find  a hired killer.
His evidence that he acted under duress was rejected by the trial Court.
As I have already said,   Thornhill-Fisher’s evidence, which was
accepted as reliable by the trial Court, was that he saw the deceased at the
warehouse at 17h00 on the fateful afternoon.     This means that the
deceased could not have been at the pharmacy at five o’clock (which is
about ten minutes by car away from the warehouse), and that the time as
deposed to by Albert in his affidavit was inaccurate and could not be relied

upon to show that the deceased  visited the pharmacy after the meeting at the
warehouse.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the effect of the reopening of
the State case was that the defence could no longer contend that the
deceased visited the pharmacy after he had been to the warehouse.    As I
have indicated, however, Albert’s oral evidence was no more reliable than
his affidavit and was ignored by the trial Court.    On all the other evidence,
particularly that of Reynolds, supported by  the overwhelming probabilities,
there can be no doubt that the deceased’s  visit to the pharmacy took place
before he arrived at the warehouse.    It was conceded by counsel for the
appellant that the defence did not apply for Reynolds to be recalled.    In the
result Albert’s oral evidence did not in any way affect the State case against
the appellant and no injustice was done by the re-opening of the State case.
For the reasons I have given I am of the view that the re-opening of

the State case did not constitute an irregularity within the meaning of sec
317 (1) of the Act.
The appeal is dismissed.

In the matter of:
GUARDIAN NATIONAL INSURANCE
COMPANY LIMITED
Appellant
and
MATTHEW STEPHEN CHARLES SEARLE N O
Respondent
CORAM:   VIVIER, HOWIE, MARAIS, OLIVIER and SCHUTZ JJA
DATE OF HEARING: 23 February 1999
DATE OF DELIVERY: 1 March 1999
Appealability - Rulings during trial.

J U D G M E N T
/HOWIE JA:. . .

This case concerns a loss of support claim brought on behalf
of Samantha Searle whose parents were killed in a motor accident on 22
December 1989 when she was 13.   The action was instituted under the
applicable motor vehicle insurance legislation, the appellant insurance
company being the  defendant.
The joint will of her parents appointed Samantha and her
brother equal heirs and directed that her share of their estates be held in
trust for her care and maintenance until  majority.   Apart from insurance
monies (which, in terms of the Assessment of Damages Act 9 of 1969,
have to be left out of the reckoning in a matter such as this), Samantha
inherited shares and cash as well as an undivided half-share of immovable
property and certain furniture and personal effects.   The monies thus due
to her were later paid into trust and from time to time the trustee made
payments in respect of her maintenance and education.
When the case came before Ngoepe J in the High Court at

Pretoria the only unresolved element of the claim was the quantum of
damages.   By that stage the parties had each employed an actuary.   On
certain aspects of quantum the actuaries were in agreement, inter alia,
that a deduction from the assessed loss of support had to be made in
respect of the value of the accelerated receipt of the inheritance.   They
differed, however, amongst other things, on the method of calculation of
that deduction.   Accordingly, for the purposes of the hearing, the parties
drew up a memorandum.   In it they stated their agreement that “the value
of the inheritance” (sic) should be determined as at the date of trial but
declared their inability to resolve the divergent actuarial approaches to
calculation, which they recorded as follows:
“2.1
The Plaintiff (relying upon the views of Actuary G W
JACOBSON) assumes a nil increase in the value of the
estate assets between the date of death and the date of trial.
2.2
The Defendant (relying upon the views of Actuary R J
KOCH) assumes escalation in line with inflation as from 1

March 1995 to the date of the trial as a means for estimating
the actual current value of the assets as at date of trial.  In
addition the Defendant asserts that the payments actually
received by the claimant from the trust to date of trial should
be taken into account.”
In his opening address at the start of the trial counsel for the
plaintiff informed the Court that the parties, through their actuaries, were
able to perform all the necessary calculations involved in the assessment
of quantum and that what they sought from the Court was “a
determination of principle”, which, once made, would enable them to
undertake the “mechanical process” of calculating the amount of
Samantha’s loss.   The principle, said counsel, was really a legal question
and involved three parts: (a) whether, by way of the payment from the
estates to the trust,  Samantha had received accelerated benefits as a result
of her parents’ death; (b) whether the income received by her from the
trust fell to be deducted from the amount of support lost; and, (c) the
method of calculating the value of any accelerated benefit received.   The

response of counsel for the defendant was to challenge the relevance of
(a) (given that accelerated receipt of benefits was in effect admitted in the
particulars of claim) and to confirm that (b)and (c) were indeed the issues
on which the parties sought “a ruling”.
Question (c) was, of course, the question formulated in the
memorandum and (b) was thus informally added.  It would appear  from
the record that the learned Judge was neither asked to make any
determination under Rule 33(4) defining the ambit of the hearing or the
questions sought to be resolved, nor did he.
The hearing then proceeded and evidence was given by Mr
Jacobson and Dr Koch on behalf of the respective parties.   It is
unnecessary for present purposes to summarise their testimony.   Through
little fault of their own much of their evidence was unclear and perhaps
gave rise more to uncertainty than finality.   At all events, in the course of
the hearing it emerged that the actuaries also differed as to whether any

allowance should be made for Samantha’s inheritance of a share of the
furniture and other movables (as distinct from her share of the immovable
property) and, if so, how such allowance should be computed.  This
dispute arose because she had already enjoyed their use during her
parents’ lifetime.   Although these questions were not put to the Court for
a ruling it would seem that counsel for defendant, subsequently,  during
the course of argument, urged that they be answered in the judgment.
Having reserved its decision,  the Court below delivered a
judgment which concluded with four rulings.   Only two are presently
relevant.   They read as follows:
“(ii)
No escalation to meet inflation is to be made in respect of
Samantha’s inheritance for the period 22 December 1989 to
date of trial.
(iii)
With regard to property and movables, the calculation of
Samantha’s benefit be made on the basis adopted by Mr W
Jacobson, with the proviso that the 25% also applies in
respect of movables.”

Despite the assurances in the opening address that the parties
were able and ready to proceed with the necessary calculations once the
Court’s requested rulings were given, they failed to act accordingly.   The
quantum of damages - the element of the claim awaiting finalisation - was
left unresolved.   Instead, the defendant sought the trial Judge’s leave to
appeal.   At the hearing of that application counsel for the plaintiff
opposed it but only on the merits, not on the ground that the rulings were
unappealable.   In a short judgment the Judge granted leave to appeal to
this Court without addressing the question of appealability.
At the hearing of the appeal counsel were asked in limine to
deal separately with that question.   Consequent upon their argument it
was ordered that the matter be struck off the roll.   Judgment on  the costs
of appeal was reserved.   The reasons for that order and the judgment on
costs now follow.   (I shall continue to refer to the parties as “the
plaintiff” and “the defendant” respectively.)

As previous decisions of this Court indicate, there are still
sound grounds for a basic approach which avoids  the piecemeal appellate
disposal of the issues in litigation.   It is unnecessarily expensive and
generally it is desirable, for obvious reasons, that such issues be resolved
by the same court and at one and the same time.   Where this approach
has been relaxed it has been because the judicial decisions in question,
whether referred to as judgments, orders, rulings or declarations, had
three attributes.   First, they were final in effect and not susceptible of
alteration by the court of first instance.   Secondly, they were definitive of
the rights  of the parties e g because they granted definite and distinct
relief.   Thirdly, they had the effect of disposing of at least a substantial
portion of the relief claimed.   In this regard see Zweni v Minister of Law
and Order 1993 (1) SA 523 (A) at 532 I - 533 B.
In the present case, if the parties do not eventually settle the claim,
the issue of quantum can only be disposed of when the trial Court makes

its award of damages.   There being no separate and distinct heads under
which the claim has been brought, the resolution of one or some of which
could have been dealt with as a separate issue, there can also be no
question here of partial disposal.  Moreover, this case is clearly
distinguishable from Van Streepen & Germs (Pty) Ltd v Transvaal
Provincial Administration 1987 (4) SA 569 (A), on which counsel for the
defendant relied, because there the decision found to be appealable was
one upholding a defence which limited the recoverable damages.
Plainly, the rulings here have neither the second nor third
of the required attributes.   That is enough to disqualify them as
appealable decisions.   I say that because  the first attribute - assuming it
were present - cannot on its own confer appealability.   A trial court’s
factual findings are unalterable (absent  re-opening) but they are merely
steps along the way towards the final conclusion and consequent order.
They certainly do not in themselves dispose of even a portion of the relief

claimed.   At best for the defendant the rulings in this case were merely
such findings or to be equated with such findings.   However, the point
goes further.  Even if the rulings were unalterable it is distinctly
questionable at this stage whether they will have any final effect.   It is
clear that if in due course the trial proceeds, the various actuarial
calculations will be made and presented to the Judge.   On long-standing
authority he will not be bound by any of them.   Rather, it will be for him
to consider their impact and assess their conformity to the general equities
of the case  before making such award as in his view is fair to both sides.
(Hulley v Cox 1923 AD 234 at 243 - 4; Legal Insurance Company Ltd
v Botes 1963 (1) SA 608 (A) at 614 F; and General Accident Insurance
Co SA Ltd v Summers 1987 (3) SA 577 (A) at 608 I - J.)   This process
of assessment may well involve, subsequent to the Judge’s acceptance of
a particular sum as correctly calculated in accordance with his  rulings, its
effective reduction as a result of allowances for contingencies not yet

considered or allowances to accommodate the equities.   Such reduction
could be substantial.   It could in fact bring the awarded sum closer to the
defendant’s assessment than to the plaintiff’s.
That prompts one to look at the question of appealability
from another angle.   If the matter now before us were pursued to
conclusion, our judgment would not, for reasons already stated, dispose
of the issue of quantum.   Accordingly, when eventually the trial Court’s
award is made it could be open to either party to appeal on the basis that
the award was either sufficiently inadequate or excessive  as to warrant
appellate interference.   In other words there could be two appeals in the
same case in relation to the same issue.  That would be squarely in
conflict with the basic approach which generally shuns piecemeal appeals.
The continuing need for that approach is well illustrated by the following
consideration.   The eventual award might bear little or no trace of having
been influenced by these rulings.   In other words in the postulated further

appeal they would have no relevance.   In that event an appeal now
would have had no bearing on the final outcome of the claim.   Such a
situation is to be avoided.   Appeals must be entertained upon issues
which are live, not academic.   And cost-effectiveness is also a most
material consideration.  The enquiry as to appealability is therefore
“whether an appeal will necessarily lead to a more expeditious and cost-
effective final determination of the main dispute between the parties and,
as such, will decisively contribute to its final solution” (Zweni’s case at
531 J - 532 A).
A somewhat similar formulation is to be found in
Priday t/a Pride Paving v Rubin 1992 (3) SA 542 (C) at 547 E, save that
the reference there was not to “the main dispute” but to “one or more of
the disputes”,  a phrase on which counsel for defendant sought to call in
aid.  It does not assist him.   Manifestly the disputes which the trial judge
in Priday had in mind could not realistically have been disputes on
evidential issues or, as here, disputes about methods of calculation.   They

were obviously disputes the resolution of which would pronounce finally
upon the claim or defence concerned or a substantive element of the claim
or defence.   One may put it this way.   If the rulings in question here are
still relevant after the final award, then the defendant will be at liberty to
attack them in the course of an appeal against the quantum of the award.
If they are not, there will be no justification for an appeal directed  against
them.   And if such an appeal against the rulings will not be justified then,
as may  be the case,  plainly it will not have been justified now.
As to the disposal of disputes in an efficient and cost-
effective way,   what remains to be done in the trial in the instant case
cannot take much Court time.   Subsequent to the award,  when made, the
defendant will, if armed with grounds for leave to appeal, have the
opportunity to appeal in any event.   Accordingly no reasons of
practicality or economics warrant an appeal at this juncture.
It remains to mention that counsel for defendant relied on the

judgments in Moch v Nedtravel (Pty) Ltd  t/a American Express Travel
Service 1996 (3) SA 1 (A) at 10 F - G and Beinash v Wixley 1997 (3) SA
721 (SCA) at 730 C - E.   Moch’s case concerned an appeal against
refusal of a recusal application.   It was held that the refusal was
tantamount to a decision on a plea to jurisdiction.   It therefore bore very
definitely on the parties’ rights and the relief claimed in the main
proceedings.   In Beinash the appeal before this Court was found to
provide the only opportunity and the only forum the aspirant appellant
could possibly have for the correction of the alleged wrong of which he
complained.   The situation here is so materially different that the Beinash
case can have no application.
For the reasons advanced so far the rulings of the Court a
quo are not appealable.
Contemplating the possibility of that conclusion, counsel for
defendant asked that the matter be postponed rather than struck off the

roll.  The short answer is that the eventual award and the reasons for it
may conceivably provide inadequate grounds on which to grant the
defendant leave to appeal afresh.   In that event there could be no
justification for having the present proceedings still pending.
Turning to the question of the appeal costs, counsel for the
defendant submitted, with reference to the case of Kett v Afro Adventures
(Pty) Ltd 1997 (1) SA 62 (A), that the parties should bear their own costs.
In Kett the appellant sought and obtained leave to appeal from the Court
of first instance.   The issue of appealability was not raised then, or in the
heads of argument on appeal, but only by this Court some time before the
appeal.   The appellant readily conceded the point  and the appeal was
struck off the roll.   In exercising its discretion as to costs this Court took
into account three factors (at 66 H - J):   (i) the appellant initiated and
prosecuted the appeal;  (ii) she did not persist with it once the point of
non-appealability was raised; and  (iii) the respondents could not be

absolved entirely because the point should have occurred to their legal
advisers and the Court of first instance would not have given leave had
either party raised it.   The appellant was therefore ordered to pay only
two-thirds of the respondents’ wasted appeal costs.
It was common cause between counsel in the present case
that when the defendant sought leave to appeal in the Court below its
counsel raised, and presented argument on, the question of appealability.
Counsel for the plaintiff, however, opposed leave solely on the merits.
The absence of any reference to the point in the judgment granting leave
to appeal would seem to indicate that the Judge saw the matter as so
clearly appealable that no discussion or reasons in that regard were
necessary.   He may nonetheless, of course, have been induced to think
so  by the omission of counsel for the plaintiff to deal with the subject.
That possibility must necessarily be borne in mind.
On the other hand it is clear enough from what we were told

by counsel for the defendant that his client was most concerned to obtain
this Court’s resolution of the actuarial dispute for the purposes not only
of the present case but many other matters as well.   This would explain,
no doubt, why the defendant sought leave to appeal without completion
of the trial, was ready to address the Court below on the topic and, unlike
the appellant in Kett’s case, persisted in contending for appealability even
after argument on the subject was requested by this Court in advance of
the hearing.   There is therefore no reason to conclude that had the
plaintiff at any stage contended for non-appealability the defendant would
have relented.   Nor, in all the circumstances, is there really sufficient
reason to think that had the plaintiff so argued the Court below would
have refused leave.   There are therefore material differences between this
case and Kett’s.   Their effect is such that there is less reason here to
relieve the defendant of portion of what, it would seem, should otherwise
be its costs liability.   Giving due weight to the above-mentioned omission

by the plaintiff’s counsel to argue the question of appealability before the
Judge, I rate that factor as insufficient to warrant penalising the plaintiff.
It is therefore right that the defendant bear the wasted costs of appeal.  It
is ordered accordingly.
